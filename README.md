# SoftFocus

SoftFocus is a governed, non-clinical analytical system
focused on cognitive load, recovery capacity, and compensation.

The project is designed as a **long-term operational asset**,
not a coaching tool, diagnostic system, or behavioral product.

## What SoftFocus Does

SoftFocus helps identify whether **recovery closes under sustained cognitive load**.

It provides:
- structured orientation
- analytical language
- visibility into compensation patterns

It does **not** provide:
- recommendations

- treatment
- coaching or behavioral guidance

## Project Bundles

## Summary

SoftFocus is stable, governed, and intentionally constrained.

Changes are allowed only where they do not introduce
semantic drift, behavioral direction, or clinical framing.
