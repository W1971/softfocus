SoftFocus — Maintenance Execution Policy
Professional Operational Standard

Version: v1.2
Status: CANONICAL
Applies to: Humans, CI, Automation
Enforcement Level: STRICT

==================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Maintenance scripts perform intentional and irreversible repository mutation.
They are operational tools, not authority mechanisms.

Accordingly:
- Maintenance scripts are NOT exposed via sf
- Maintenance scripts are executed explicitly and intentionally
- Maintenance scripts are NEVER part of CI release workflows

Any deviation constitutes an architectural violation.

==================================================

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

- Maintenance scripts are NOT exposed via sf
- Maintenance scripts are executed explicitly and intentionally
- Maintenance scripts are NEVER part of CI release workflows
- Maintenance scripts MUST NOT influence READY / NOT READY decisions

These rules are absolute.

==================================================

ALLOWED INVOCATION (EXPLICIT ONLY)

If invoked manually, usage MUST be explicit:

MODE=dry-run ./scripts/maintenance/project-cleanup.sh
MODE=apply   ./scripts/maintenance/project-cleanup.sh

Invocation requirements:
- Full script path
- Explicit MODE
- No wrappers
- No aliases
- No abbreviations
- No shorthand aliases are permitted

==================================================

FORBIDDEN INVOCATION

The following invocations are strictly forbidden:

sf governance cleanup
sf ready cleanup
sf maintenance cleanup

Any maintenance command exposed as governance is invalid by definition.

==================================================

CI RULES

- CI MUST NOT execute maintenance scripts
- CI MUST fail immediately if maintenance scripts are executed implicitly
- CI MUST NOT mask or suppress maintenance-related execution

Maintenance is a human-authorized operation only.

==================================================

AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

Maintenance execution implies:
- human responsibility
- traceability
- reviewability

Automation, silence, or convenience are not acceptable justifications.

==================================================

ARCHITECTURAL RATIONALE

Maintenance implies mutation.
Mutation implies responsibility.
Authority implies immutability.

These concerns MUST remain separated.

==================================================

FINAL CONSTRAINT

If a command makes SoftFocus easier to operate
by weakening authority boundaries,
that command is invalid.
