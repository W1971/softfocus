An axis may be approved only if it:

- explains user-reported states not covered by burnout
- remains strictly non-clinical
- can be expressed without advice

- fits mobile-first interpretation
- does not require user behavior change to function

---

## Axes Under Consideration

- Decision Saturation
- Cognitive Load Variability
- Temporal Compression / Time Fragmentation
- Chronic Context Switching

No other axes are in scope.

- resilience
- discipline

---

## Approval Rules
