# Sleep Calculator: Recovery and Deficit

This tool helps assess the **operational state of recovery**
based on your current sleep pattern over the past 7 days.

Sleep is one of the core mechanisms for recovering **cognitive load**.
When the sleep regime is chronically disrupted, a recovery deficit accumulates,
increasing the **risk of burnout** as an operational condition that affects
work sustainability and decision quality.

SoftFocus is a deliberately non-medical project.  
The result describes your **sleep regime and its compensation**, not a health condition.

## How to use

- answer based on observable facts from the past 7 days  
- choose the option that most often reflects reality  
- the result is deterministic: the same inputs always produce the same output  

---

## What you will receive

- a classification of the **burnout stage** from a recovery perspective  
- the primary risk under the current cognitive load  
- a short interpretation of why this state has formed  
- signals indicating when reassessment becomes meaningful  

---

## Tool limitations

This tool does not use clinical norms and does not replace medical support.
It is designed to provide orientation around sleep patterns, recovery,
and **burnout risk** under sustained mental load.

---

## When reassessment makes sense

- if your sleep schedule shifts by 30–60 minutes and remains stable for at least a week  
- if your need for stimulation increases or decreases  
- if compensatory sleep appears or disappears
