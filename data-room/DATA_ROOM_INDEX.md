# SoftFocus — Investor Data Room Index

## Purpose

This data room provides a structured, auditable overview
of SoftFocus as a governed analytical product.

The focus is **control, readiness, and risk discipline** —
not growth storytelling.

---

## 1. Governance & Lifecycle

- docs/governance/RFC-001-Project-Lifecycle.md  
- docs/governance/RFC-PHASE-C-COGNITIVE-LOAD-v1.md  
- docs/control/OPERATIONAL_READINESS.md  
- docs/control/PHASE_C_KICKOFF_v1.md  

Key principle:
Monetization is gated by governance, not engineering.

---

## 2. Monetization Control (Phase C)

- docs/control/phase-c/MONETIZATION_DRY_RUN_REPORT.md  
- docs/control/phase-c/MONETIZATION_APPROVAL_RECORD.md  
- docs/control/phase-c/MONETIZATION_REVOKE_RECORD.md  
- docs/control/phase-c/MONETIZATION_24H_RUNBOOK.md  
- docs/control/phase-c/README_MONETIZATION_BLOCKED.md  

All monetization decisions are explicit, documented,
and reversible.

---

## 3. Metrics & Forecasting (Shadow)

- docs/metrics/SHADOW_MONETRICS_DASHBOARD.md  
- docs/metrics/SHADOW_REVENUE_FORECAST.md  
- docs/metrics/REVENUE_CONFIDENCE_BANDS.md  

Metrics are derived from **intent signals only**.
No revenue is executed or implied.

---

## 4. Investor Communication

- docs/investor/INVESTOR_VERBAL_SCRIPT_ONE_PAGE.md  
- docs/faq/FAQ_WHY_MONETIZATION_DELAYED.md  
- docs/review/REVIEW_PATH_10K_TO_25K.md  

These documents explain *why control precedes revenue*.

---

## 5. Legal & Risk Boundary

- docs/public/LEGAL_FAQ_MONETIZATION_AND_STATUS.md  
- docs/public/LEGAL_COMPLIANCE_BOUNDARY_v1.0.md  
- docs/business/ANTI_MISINTERPRETATION_FAQ.md  

SoftFocus is explicitly non-clinical and informational.

---

## Statement

SoftFocus is a production-ready analytical asset
operating under deliberate monetization constraints.

This is a governance decision, not a technical limitation.
