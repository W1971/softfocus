# SoftFocus — FINAL LOCK: Phase 1 / Phase A

Status: LOCKED  
Version: v1.0  
Scope: Product Core  

---

## Purpose

This document formally locks Phase 1 (Assessment)
and Phase A (Structured Protocol) of SoftFocus.

From this point forward, these phases are immutable.

---

## Locked Components

### Phase 1 — Assessment

The following elements are FINAL and MUST NOT be changed:

- purpose of the assessment
- assessment contract
- measured parameters
- question set structure
- response scale
- state categories
- result interpretation logic
- transition framing to protocol

No edits, refinements, or reinterpretations are allowed.

---

### Phase A — Structured Protocol

The following elements are FINAL and MUST NOT be changed:

- protocol principles
- protocol layers
- module boundaries
- non-prescriptive nature
- paid boundary framing
- UX flow logic

The protocol is structural, not instructional.
This distinction is locked.

## Prohibited Actions

After this lock, it is forbidden to:

- edit Phase 1 or Phase A documents
- adjust wording to improve conversion
- localize by reinterpretation
- introduce advice or steps
- collapse assessment and protocol logic

---

## Allowed Actions

The following actions remain allowed:

- creation of new phases
- localization with strict parity
- format changes (PDF, app)
- SEO expansion
- tooling and automation changes

None of these may alter Phase 1 / A logic.

---

## Change Procedure

1. creation of a new phase document
2. explicit reference to this lock

Overwriting or replacing locked content is prohibited.

Scripts, CI, and human processes
must treat Phase 1 and Phase A as immutable.
