# SoftFocus — Phase B Kickoff (Localization)

Version: v1.0  
Status: ACTIVE  
Previous Phases: Phase 1 / Phase A (LOCKED)

---

## Purpose

This document formally initiates **Phase B — Localization**
in the SoftFocus project.

Phase B expands access to the system
without modifying logic, structure, or meaning.

---

## Locked Foundation

The following components are LOCKED and immutable:

- Assessment logic (Phase 1)
- Protocol structure (Phase A)
- Governance v1.1
- Project structure (active / archive model)

Any change to the above requires a new phase and explicit re-lock.

---

## Scope of Phase B

Phase B includes:

- Localization of existing content
- Language-specific explanations
- Language-specific routing where defined

Phase B does NOT include:

- New logic
- New interpretations
- New advice
- Structural changes
- Conversion optimization

---

## Localization Rules (Hard)

- Structure must remain identical across languages
- Canonical terminology must be preserved
- No cultural adaptation
- No additional framing or interpretation
- No advisory or motivational language

Localization is translation, not reinterpretation.

---

## Initial Target Languages

- Russian (RU)

Additional languages require a separate kickoff.

---

## Governance Enforcement

All Phase B work is gated by:

- project-cleanup.sh
- structure-audit.sh
- full-governance-run.sh

Violations block progression.

---

## Final Declaration

As of this document:

> **Phase B (Localization) is ACTIVE.**
