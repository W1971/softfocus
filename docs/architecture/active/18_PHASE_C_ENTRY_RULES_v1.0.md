# SoftFocus — Phase C Entry Rules (Conversion Layer)

Version: v1.0  
Status: ACTIVE  
Applies To: Phase C  
Previous Phase: Phase B (LOCKED)

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory entry rules**
for starting **Phase C — Conversion Layer**
in the SoftFocus project.

No conversion-related work is permitted
outside the boundaries defined here.

---

## Preconditions (Mandatory)

Phase C may start only if **all** of the following are true:

1. Phase B is formally completed and locked.
2. Project roadmap is up to date.
3. Documentation libraries are defined and indexed.
4. Governance scripts are enforced in CI.
5. User-content guard is active.
6. Structure parity (EN↔RU) is enforced.

Failure of any condition blocks Phase C.

---

## Scope of Phase C

Phase C is limited to:

- definition of paid boundaries;
- neutral description of access limitations;
- transparent conditions for paid access.

Phase C **does not** include:
- changes to assessment logic;
- changes to result interpretation;
- advice or recommendations;
- urgency or pressure language.

---

## Hard Prohibitions

Phase C strictly forbids:

- manipulative UX patterns;
- countdowns or urgency framing;
- “best choice” or “recommended” language;
- dark patterns of any kind.

Violations invalidate the phase.

---

## Governance Controls

All Phase C work is subject to:

- existing governance policies;
- user-content guard;
- structure audits;
- test logging and READY classification.

No bypass mechanisms are allowed.

---

## Final Statement

Phase C is an **extension of access**,  
not a reinterpretation of meaning.

Any deviation from these rules
requires a new governance document
and a new version.
