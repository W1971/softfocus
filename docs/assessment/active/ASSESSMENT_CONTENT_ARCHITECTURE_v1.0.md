# SoftFocus — Assessment Content Architecture

Version: v1.0  
Status: ACTIVE

---

## Content Objective

Assessment questions must feel:

- intelligent,
- respectful of the user’s competence,
- relevant to real work conditions.

The user should feel:
"I am not being tested. I am being understood."

---

## Question Design Principles

Each question must:

- reference observable behavior,
- avoid emotional vocabulary,
- avoid self-classification prompts,
- avoid moral framing.

---

## Approved Question Style

Correct:

- “In the past two weeks, how often have you had to make decisions while mentally fatigued?”

Incorrect:

- “Do you feel burned out?”
- “Are you emotionally drained?”
- “Do you hate your job?”

---

## Cognitive Framing

Questions should target:

- decision quality,
- recovery efficiency,
- cognitive load,
- sustainability of effort.

Not:

- feelings,
- motivation,
- personal values.

---

## Temporal Anchoring

Every question must include:

- a time window (e.g. 7–14 days),
- a frequency or condition,
- a neutral reference point.

---

## Professional Tone Enforcement

Language must resemble:

- operational review,
- post-incident analysis,
- performance risk assessment.

Never:

- intervention-oriented language,
- coaching language,
- inspirational tone.
