# SoftFocus — Assessment as a Product

Version: v1.0  
Status: ACTIVE  
Scope: Core Product Definition

---

## Purpose

This document defines the SoftFocus assessment
as a **standalone product**, not a funnel artifact.

The assessment must:

- deliver value without payment,
- create intellectual engagement,
- justify return visits,
- enable sharing without dilution.

---

## Product Positioning

SoftFocus assessment is:

- not a quiz,
- not a checklist,
- not a psychological test,
- not a medical instrument.

It is a **risk-orientation tool** for high-load decision makers.

---

## Core Product Promise

After completing the assessment, a user must gain:

- clarity about their current burnout stage,
- understanding of _why_ this state exists,
- awareness of near-term risks,
- a reason to reassess in the future.

---

## Structural Properties

The assessment is:

- finite (clear end),
- deterministic (same input → same result),
- interpretable (logic visible, not mystical),
- stable across versions.

---

## Assessment Output (Free)

The free result MUST include:

1. Burnout Stage Classification
2. Primary Risk Vector
3. Short Interpretation
4. Return Trigger Explanation

This ensures value without paywall frustration.

---

## Return Mechanics (Built-in)

Each assessment result must explicitly state:

- what will change if nothing is done,
- when reassessment becomes meaningful,
- which signals justify a return.

---

## Shareability Rules

The assessment must be shareable because it is:

- intellectually defensible,
- non-embarrassing,
- non-classifying,
- language-neutral / no structured support

Sharing motivation:

> “This explained something I couldn’t name.”

---

## Prohibited Patterns

- gamification
- scoring vanity
- emotional manipulation
- urgency language
- fear framing

---

## Product Identity Statement

SoftFocus assessment is a **thinking tool**,  
not a wellness activity.
