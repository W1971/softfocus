# SoftFocus — Assessment Standards & Methodological Basis

Version: v1.0  
Status: LOCKED  
Visibility: INTERNAL  
Scope: Method justification & audit readiness

---

## Purpose

Define the **standards, principles, and frameworks**
on which the SoftFocus assessment and paid report are based.

This document explains:

- why the assessment is valid,
- why it is professional,
- why it is not a hobby test.

---

## Core Positioning

SoftFocus is **not a clinical assessment**.

It is a **non-medical, operational risk assessment**
focused on performance sustainability under cognitive load.

---

## Primary Methodological Foundations

SoftFocus is based on **four established professional domains**:

---

## 1. Occupational Burnout Research (Non-clinical use)

Reference domain:

- Occupational psychology
- Workload sustainability research

Key concepts adopted:

- burnout as a _process_, not a state
- effort–recovery imbalance
- compensation patterns
- gradual degradation

Key principle:
Burnout risk emerges structurally over time,
not as a sudden emotional collapse.

Important:
SoftFocus **does not apply clinical classification criteria**
(e.g. ICD, DSM).

---

## 2. Human Factors & Cognitive Load Theory

Reference domain:

- Human factors engineering
- Cognitive load theory
- Safety-critical system design

Key concepts adopted:

- decision fatigue
- vigilance decrement
- attention fragmentation
- error sensitivity under load

This foundation explains:

- why decision quality degrades first,
- why errors appear late,
- why professionals often miss early signals.

---

## 3. Systems & Reliability Thinking

Reference domain:

- High Reliability Organizations (HRO)
- Systems engineering
- Risk-oriented assessment

Key concepts adopted:

- leading vs lagging indicators
- latent failure conditions
- compensation masking
- structural drift

This is why SoftFocus looks at **patterns**, not feelings.

---

## 4. Longitudinal & Comparative Assessment Principles

Reference domain:

- longitudinal analysis
- trend detection
- repeated-measure interpretation

Key concepts adopted:

- same input → same output
- comparison without gamification
- trend explanation, not scoring

This underpins:

- reassessment logic
- paid report time-based scenarios

---

## Free vs Paid Assessment — Method Boundary

### Free Assessment is based on:

- domain-level pattern detection
- dominant risk vector identification
- stage classification

Purpose:
Orientation and awareness.

---

### Paid Assessment is based on:

- multi-domain interaction analysis
- time-based conditional scenarios
- recovery efficiency modeling
- decision integrity risk framing

Purpose:
Interpretation of consequences and structural risk.

---

## Why This Is Professional (Audit View)

SoftFocus methodology is professional because it is:

- grounded in established research domains
- deterministic and reproducible
- versioned and auditable
- non-classification and bounded
- suitable for individual and organizational use

---

## Explicit Exclusions

SoftFocus does NOT rely on:

- personality typing (MBTI, etc.)
- emotional self-rating scales
- clinical cognitive sustainability checklists
- motivational psychology
- coaching frameworks

---

## Stability Rule

This methodological basis is LOCKED.
Changes require:

- new versioned document
- explicit supersession
- governance review
