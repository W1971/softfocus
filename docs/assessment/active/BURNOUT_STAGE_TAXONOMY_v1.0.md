# SoftFocus — Burnout Stage Taxonomy

Version: v1.0  
Status: LOCKED  
Scope: Canonical classification language

---

## Purpose

Define a **stable, professional taxonomy**
for burnout stages used across SoftFocus.

This taxonomy is:
- non-medical,
- non-emotional,
- non-therapeutic.

---

## Design Principles

Stages represent:
- sustainability of effort,
- cost of maintaining performance,
- risk of future degradation.

They do NOT represent:
- emotional states,
- mental health diagnoses,
- motivation levels.

---

## Canonical Stages

### Stage 1 — Balanced Load

Description:
Effort and recovery are aligned.  
Performance is sustainable without compensation.

Risk Profile:
Low

---

### Stage 2 — Sustained Load

Description:
Performance is maintained through increased effort.
Recovery is present but insufficient.

Risk Profile:
Moderate (latent)

---

### Stage 3 — Compensated Strain

Description:
Performance is preserved by sacrificing recovery,
focus, or decision quality.

Risk Profile:
Elevated (structural)

---

### Stage 4 — Degradation Phase

Description:
Core functions begin to decline.
Errors, detachment, or instability appear.

Risk Profile:
High (near-term impact)

---

## Usage Rules

- Only one stage per assessment
- No hybrid labels
- No percentage scoring
- No progression promises

---

## Stability Rule

This taxonomy is **language-locked**.
Any change requires:
- new version,
- explicit supersession,
- governance review.
