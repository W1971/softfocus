without emotional framing or role stereotyping.

decision load, and recovery efficiency interact over time.

attention stability, error sensitivity, and long-term sustainability.

## For Engineering Managers & Team Leads

This assessment examines how decision density,
responsibility asymmetry, and recovery constraints
affect leadership performance under continuous load.

It does not evaluate management style.
It evaluates sustainability risk.

## For Startup Founders

This assessment focuses on sustained responsibility,
decision accumulation, and recovery erosion
under prolonged uncertainty.

It is designed for environments where “slowing down”
is rarely an option.

---

## For Healthcare Professionals

This assessment examines cognitive sustainability
under time pressure, error intolerance,
and disrupted recovery cycles.

It is non-clinical and does not evaluate competence.

---

## For Safety-Critical Operators (Aviation, Maritime, Control Rooms)

This assessment focuses on vigilance sustainability,
decision integrity, and recovery under shift-based load.

It is designed for roles where errors appear late
but carry high consequences.

---

## For Consultants & Analysts

This assessment examines sustained analytical load,
context switching, and decision fatigue
across prolonged high-responsibility cycles.

---

## Tone Enforcement

All occupation-specific intros must:
- avoid emotional language,
- avoid praise or reassurance,
- signal analytical relevance.
