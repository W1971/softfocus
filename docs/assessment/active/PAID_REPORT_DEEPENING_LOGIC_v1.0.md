# SoftFocus — Paid Report Deepening Logic

Version: v1.0  
Status: ACTIVE  
Scope: Value differentiation (Free → Paid)

---

## Purpose

Define **what fundamentally changes**
when a user unlocks the paid report.

Paid access must deepen understanding,
not repeat free content.

---

## Core Principle

Free result answers:
> “Where am I?”

Paid report answers:
> “What happens if nothing changes — and why?”

---

## Dimensions Unlocked in Paid Report

### 1. Multi-Vector Risk Mapping

Paid report expands from:
- single primary vector

To:
- secondary risks,
- interaction effects,
- compounding patterns.

---

### 2. Time-Based Scenarios

Paid report includes:
- 30-day projection
- 60-day projection

Scenarios are:
- conditional,
- non-deterministic,
- framed as risk evolution.

---

### 3. Recovery Efficiency Analysis

Paid report evaluates:
- whether recovery exists,
- whether it is effective,
- where it fails structurally.

No lifestyle advice.
No structured support framing.

---

### 4. Decision Integrity Signal

Paid report identifies:
- where decision quality is most at risk,
- what type of errors are likely.

This is the **core professional value**.

---

## What Paid Report Still Does NOT Do

- no classification
- no coaching
- no prescriptions
- no urgency tactics

---

## Value Justification

User should feel:
> “This explains consequences I hadn’t connected.”

Not:
> “This tells me what to do.”

---

## Boundary Statement

The paid report remains:
- interpretive,
- analytical,
- governance-safe.
