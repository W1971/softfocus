# SoftFocus — Result Comparison Model (Longitudinal)

Version: v1.0  
Status: ACTIVE  
Scope: Repeat assessment interpretation

---

## Purpose

Define how **multiple assessment results**
are compared over time without gamification,
pressure, or emotional framing.

---

## Core Principle

SoftFocus comparisons are:
- interpretive, not competitive
- trend-based, not score-based
- explanatory, not judgmental

---

## Comparison Dimensions

When two or more assessments exist,
comparison focuses on:

1. Burnout Stage Stability or Shift
2. Primary Risk Vector Change
3. Recovery Efficiency Trend
4. Load Compensation Direction

---

## Allowed Comparison Statements

Examples:
- “Your burnout stage remains stable, but recovery efficiency has declined.”
- “Primary risk has shifted from cognitive load to decision fatigue.”
- “Sustained load indicators have increased since the previous assessment.”

---

## Prohibited Comparison Patterns

- score deltas
- improvement language
- regression shaming
- streaks or achievements

---

## Time Relevance Rule

Comparisons are meaningful only if:
- assessments are ≥ 14 days apart
- workload context is comparable

If not, comparison must be suppressed.

---

## Product Value

Longitudinal comparison enables users to:
- recognize trends,
- validate intuition,
- detect silent degradation.

---

## Identity Statement

SoftFocus comparisons answer:
> “What is changing — and why that matters.”
