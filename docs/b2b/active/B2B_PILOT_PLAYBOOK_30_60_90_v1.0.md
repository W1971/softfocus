# SoftFocus — B2B Pilot Playbook (30–60–90 Days)

Version: v1.0  
Status: ACTIVE  
Audience: B2B stakeholders  
Purpose: Controlled pilot execution

---

## Objective

Run a **low-risk, non-clinical pilot**
to detect burnout risk patterns
without individual profiling or medical framing.

---

## Days 0–30 — Pilot Setup & Baseline

Actions:
- define pilot scope (team / function),
- communicate non-clinical purpose,
- deploy assessment link,
- collect anonymized responses.

Outputs:
- baseline burnout stage distribution,
- dominant risk vectors,
- participation rate.

Constraints:
- no individual reports,
- no HR action linkage,
- voluntary participation only.

---

## Days 31–60 — Pattern Interpretation

Actions:
- analyze aggregated results,
- identify risk concentrations,
- review role-specific vectors,
- prepare management-level brief.

Outputs:
- sustainability risk summary,
- early warning indicators,
- structural pressure points.

---

## Days 61–90 — Reassessment & Decision Support

Actions:
- optional reassessment,
- compare patterns longitudinally,
- evaluate pilot value.

Outputs:
- stability vs drift signals,
- executive-level insight,
- go / no-go recommendation.

---

## What This Pilot Is Not

- not a wellbeing program,
- not a performance evaluation,
- not a diagnostic initiative.

---

## Pilot Success Criteria

- clarity without controversy,
- useful signals without stigma,
- leadership understanding of risk.
