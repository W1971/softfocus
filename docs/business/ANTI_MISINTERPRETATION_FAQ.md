# SoftFocus — Anti-Misinterpretation FAQ

## Purpose

This FAQ addresses common misunderstandings
encountered during sales, procurement, or legal review.

It defines **what SoftFocus is not**.

---

### Is SoftFocus a mental health or wellbeing product?

No.

SoftFocus is an analytical system that describes
operational sustainability under cognitive load.

It does not provide mental health support,
therapy, or wellbeing interventions.

---

### Does SoftFocus diagnose burnout?

No.

Burnout in SoftFocus is an analytical signal,
not a medical or psychological diagnosis.

---

### Does SoftFocus tell users what to do?

No.

SoftFocus does not provide recommendations,
action plans, or behavioral guidance.

It explains constraints, not solutions.

---

### Can SoftFocus be used for HR decisions?

No.

SoftFocus outputs must not be used for:
- performance evaluation,
- promotion or dismissal decisions,
- individual employee monitoring.

B2B usage is restricted to anonymized,
aggregated insight.

---

### Does SoftFocus replace existing wellbeing programs?

No.

SoftFocus complements existing initiatives
by explaining why certain efforts may fail,
but it does not replace clinical, HR,
or wellbeing services.

---

### Does SoftFocus promise improvement or recovery?

No.

SoftFocus makes no promises of change,
improvement, or outcomes.

It provides clarity, not guarantees.

---

### Is SoftFocus a medical or regulated product?

No.

SoftFocus operates strictly outside medical,
clinical, and therapeutic domains.

---

## Final Note

SoftFocus is designed to reduce misunderstanding,
not to drive action.

Misuse of the system outside documented boundaries
violates its governance model.
