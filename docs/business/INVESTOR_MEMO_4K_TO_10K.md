# Investor Memo — Path from $4k to $10k MRR

## Current State
- Production-ready system
- Monetization disabled by governance
- Demand measured via shadow signals
- No revenue risk exposure

## Baseline Monetization ($4k)
- One-time analytical reports
- Price: ~$29
- Volume: ~140 sales/month
- Channels: organic assessments only

## Expansion Levers (No Pressure)
1. Role-specific deep reports
2. Language expansion (EN, ES)
3. Secondary analytical products
4. Corporate individual purchases (no B2B sales)

## Why This Scales Safely
- No subscriptions
- No retention dependency
- No promises or outcomes
- Full revocation capability

## Risk Profile
- Low legal risk
- Low operational overhead
- Predictable demand
- Fully auditable decisions

## Target ($10k)
Achieved by:
- 2–3 parallel analytical products
- Same governance model
- No change in user pressure

This is not a growth bet.
This is controlled monetization of an analytical asset.
