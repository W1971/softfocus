Audience: Executives, HR, Operations, Risk  
Length: One page

## The Problem

In knowledge-intensive organizations,
burnout rarely appears as an immediate failure.

Instead, it emerges as:

- declining decision quality,
- hidden compensation,
- reduced recovery effectiveness,
- delayed errors with high cost.

Traditional tools detect problems late
or rely on self-reported feelings.

---

## The SoftFocus Approach

SoftFocus provides a **non-clinical, risk-oriented assessment**
focused on performance sustainability.

It evaluates:

- decision load under fatigue,
- cognitive sustainability,
- recovery efficiency,
- attention stability.

The assessment identifies **leading indicators**
before performance visibly degrades.

---

## What Organizations Receive

- anonymized, aggregated insights,
- burnout stage distribution (non-clinical),
- dominant risk vectors by role or function,
- early warning signals for degradation.

No individual diagnosis.
No therapy framing.

---

## Why This Is Different

- structured and reproducible,
- safe to deploy at work,
- non-stigmatizing,
- designed for longitudinal use.

SoftFocus complements existing wellbeing efforts
without replacing clinical support.

---

## Typical Use Cases

- engineering and product teams,
- leadership and management layers,
- healthcare and safety-critical roles,
- operations and coordination units.

---

## Core Value

SoftFocus helps organizations answer:
**“Where is sustainability at risk before it becomes costly?”**
