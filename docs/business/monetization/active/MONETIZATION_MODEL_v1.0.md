# SoftFocus — Monetization Model

Version: v1.0  
Status: ACTIVE  
Goal: $4 000 / month  
Scope: Wellbeing / Burnout Risk Assessment

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **only allowed monetization model**
for SoftFocus under locked architectural and governance constraints.

It does not alter:
- assessment logic
- release rules
- indexing rules
- governance phases

---

## Revenue Target

Monthly target: **$4 000**

This target must be reachable without:
- medical claims
- human-delivered therapy
- coaching dependency
- manual operations

---

## Allowed Revenue Streams

### 1. Paid Personal Burnout Report (B2C)

Role: Primary revenue anchor

Price: **$39 (one-time)**  
Delivery: Automated PDF  
Access: Post-assessment only

Assumptions:
- 5 000 assessments / month
- 2% conversion

Revenue:
- 100 × $39 = **$3 900**

---

### 2. Light B2B Snapshot (Optional stabilizer)

Product: Team Burnout Risk Snapshot  
Format: Aggregated, anonymous  
No individual profiling

Price: **$299**

Assumption:
- 1 sale / month

Revenue:
- **$299**

---

## Explicitly Forbidden Monetization

- subscriptions without prior paid report
- emotional upsell or fear-based pricing
- dynamic pricing by vulnerability
- medical diagnostics
- live coaching as core revenue

---

## Compliance Statement

This model:
- respects Architecture Constraints
- does not require script changes
- does not modify release logic
- does not introduce governance bypass

---

## Final Note

SoftFocus monetizes **clarity and risk awareness**,  
not wellbeing promises.
