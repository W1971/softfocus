## What SoftFocus Is

SoftFocus is not a wellness app.
It does not diagnose.
It does not treat.

SoftFocus is a **thinking framework**
for understanding burnout risk.

---

## Our Perspective

We view burnout as:
- a sustainability problem,
- a decision-quality risk,
- a structural imbalance over time.

Not as:
- a personal failure,
- a lack of motivation,
- an emotional weakness.

---

## How the Assessment Works

The assessment looks at:
- how effort is sustained,
- how recovery functions,
- how decisions are affected under load.

We focus on **patterns**, not feelings.

---

## Why the Language Is Different

We avoid emotional language because:
- professionals already know they are tired,
- emotions fluctuate,
- structure does not.

We use operational language to make results:
- shareable,
- non-judgmental,
- useful over time.

---

## What SoftFocus Does Not Do

- no diagnoses
- no therapy
- no coaching
- no promises of improvement

---

## Why People Come Back

People return to SoftFocus when:
- responsibility increases,
- decisions feel heavier,
- recovery stops working.

The assessment gains meaning with time.

---

## Final Note

SoftFocus exists to help people say:
> “This explains what I’m experiencing — clearly.”
