# SoftFocus — Return Loop Content Model

Version: v1.0  
Status: ACTIVE

---

## Purpose

Define why users return to SoftFocus
without notifications, pressure, or addiction mechanics.

---

## Return Triggers

Users return when:

- workload pattern changes,
- decision fatigue becomes noticeable,
- recovery stops working,
- responsibility increases.

---

## Content Anchors

Each assessment result must include:

- a future-facing statement,
- a conditional trigger (“If X happens…”),
- a suggested reassessment window.

Example:
“If decision confidence continues to decline, reassessment in 3–4 weeks is meaningful.”

---

## Longitudinal Value

SoftFocus content is designed to:

- gain meaning over time,
- improve through comparison,
- remain interpretable without memory.

---

## What We Do NOT Use

- streaks
- badges
- reminders that shame
- artificial check-ins

---

## Loop Identity

The loop is **rational**, not habitual.
