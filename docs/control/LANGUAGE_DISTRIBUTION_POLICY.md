# Language Distribution Policy

## Purpose

This document defines how SoftFocus expands across languages
without fragmenting product logic or governance.

## Rules

1. Each language has its own directory and URL space.
2. Core products remain conceptually identical across languages.
3. Role pages may be localized, not reinvented.
4. Protocol content is never fully public in any language.

## Order of expansion

Primary: EN
Secondary: ES
Tertiary: AR

No language is expanded until the previous one is stable.
