# SoftFocus Mobile v1 — COMPLETE

## Status

COMPLETE

---

## Scope delivered

Mobile v1 includes:
- result screen orientation surface
- mobile result schema
- mobile policy and anti-requirements
- observation and regression detection
- CI enforcement

---

## What Mobile v1 does well

- Reduces cognitive pressure
- Provides orientation without action
- Fits fragmented attention states
- Avoids engagement traps

---

## What Mobile v1 intentionally does not do

- Drive behavior
- Optimize engagement
- Provide solutions or plans
- Compete for attention

---

## Next possible phase

Any further development requires:
- explicit Mobile v2 proposal
- governance approval
- version bump

Until then, Mobile v1 is considered stable
and closed to expansion.
