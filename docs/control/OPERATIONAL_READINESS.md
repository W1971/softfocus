# SoftFocus — Operational Readiness v1

**Status:** DECLARED  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Scope:** System-wide  
**Effective date:** upon merge  
**Mutability:** Frozen for v1.x

---

## Purpose

This document declares SoftFocus v1
as an operationally ready analytical system.

From this point forward:
- product logic is frozen
- UX flow is fixed
- governance rules are enforced
- the system is treated as a long-term asset

No informal interpretation overrides this document.

---

## Declared Operational State

SoftFocus v1 satisfies all conditions
required for controlled operation.

### Confirmed:

- Deterministic analytical core
- Frozen recovery scoring logic
- Canonical analytical axis:
  burnout → recovery → compensation
- Non-clinical boundary enforced
- Governance-aware content validation
- Auditable monetization readiness
- UX flow locked and enforced

---

## Canonical UX Flow (Frozen)

The only allowed user flow is:

pSEO Entry (role + locale)
        ↓
Unified Burnout Assessment
        ↓
Canonical Interpretation Layer (mandatory)
        ↓
Optional Analytical Depth (Calculators)

No alternative flows are permitted.

---

## UX Enforcement Rules

### Entry
- Landing pages do not lead to calculators
- No step-based or action-oriented CTAs
- No promises of change or improvement

### Interpretation
- Mandatory after assessment
- Central meaning anchor
- Required before analytical depth

### Calculators
- Secondary analytical tools
- Not entry points
- No behavioral guidance
- No “next step” framing

---

## Calculator Alignment Confirmation

All calculators and result screens:

- Use orientation-only language
- Avoid advice or recommendations
- Avoid progress or improvement framing
- Present scores as analytical indices
- Present penalties as contributing factors

CTA elements are not permitted
in result or calculator screens.

---

## Content & Language Freeze

For SoftFocus v1.x:

- Terminology is frozen
- Canonical explanations are authoritative
- pSEO pages may be added only if:
  - they follow the canonical template
  - they do not introduce new concepts
  - they do not alter interpretation

Any deviation requires an RFC
and a version increment.

---

## Governance Authority

This document overrides:
- frontend preferences
- content experimentation
- growth or SEO optimizations
- informal UX decisions

If implementation diverges,
implementation must be corrected.

---

## Allowed Changes After Declaration

Permitted without RFC:
- bug fixes
- copy typo fixes
- infrastructure maintenance
- language translations (content-only)

Not permitted without RFC:
- new analytical axes
- changes to scoring logic
- UX flow modifications
- behavioral or advisory content

---

## Operational Mode

After this declaration:

- SoftFocus v1 is treated as an operational asset
- Feature work is paused
- Changes are governance-gated
- Phase B expansion is limited to surface only

---

## Exit Conditions

SoftFocus remains in this state until:
- a new RFC explicitly opens Phase C
- or the project is formally sunset

Until then,
this operational state is binding.


## Mobile UI Governance Gate

Mobile UI changes are blocked by a mandatory CI audit gate.
