# Payment Governance

Payments act only as entitlement triggers.

Rules:
- Payment success does not imply access.
- Access is granted only via entitlement execution.
- All deliveries must be auditable via run.jsonl.
- UI or email delivery must not bypass entitlement logic.

Violations invalidate delivery.
