**Version:** v1.0  
**Phase:** B (Stabilization)  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Date:** 2026-01-26  
**Reference Tag:** v1.0.0-operational

---

## Declaration

This document formally declares **Phase B (Stabilization)** complete.

SoftFocus v1 has successfully transitioned from Phase A (Observation)
to a stable operational state under enforced governance.

All criteria defined in Phase B kickoff documentation
have been met and verified.

---

## Verified Conditions

### Governance
- Deterministic readiness evaluation (`generate-status v2`)
- Mandatory RUN_ID enforcement
- FAIL-only semantics (no WARN tolerance)
- Alias execution evidence recorded and auditable

### Product Logic
- Recovery Scoring v1 remains **frozen**
- Canonical analytical axis unchanged
- No adaptive, clinical, or behavioral logic introduced

### Frontend & Runtime
- Production build passes without warnings
- Type contracts enforced across calculators and mobile UI
- Calculator content normalized and validated

### Operations
- Execution audit trail present
- Maintenance and audit scripts in place
- Operational readiness declared and documented

---

## Scope Closure

Phase B is now **closed**.

From this point forward:
- No changes to v1 logic are permitted
- No analytical expansion is allowed without RFC approval
- All further work must proceed under **Phase C governance**

---

## Next Allowed Action

The only permitted next step is:

> **Creation of a Phase C RFC**

Any Phase C activity without an approved RFC
is considered a governance violation.

---

## Sign-off

Phase B completion is final and irreversible.

SoftFocus v1 is now treated as an **operational asset**.
