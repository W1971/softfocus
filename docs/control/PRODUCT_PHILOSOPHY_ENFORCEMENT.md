# Product Philosophy Enforcement

## Status

Active for SoftFocus v1.x.

---

## Enforcement Principle

Product philosophy is treated as
a **hard constraint**, not inspiration.

Violations are defects.

---

## Applies To

- assessments
- calculators
- result screens
- protocol surfaces
- mobile and desktop UI
- product copy

---

## Review Questions (Mandatory)

Before any change ships:

1. Does this reduce surface complexity?
2. Does this remove something else?
3. Does this feel inevitable rather than clever?
4. Does it work without explanation?
5. Would removing it improve clarity?

If any answer is “no”,
the change must not ship.

---

## Relationship to Governance

This enforcement operates alongside:

- non-clinical boundary rules
- content-validator constraints
- mobile freeze policies

No exception process exists.

---

## Summary

SoftFocus treats simplicity
as a form of correctness.

If something feels impressive,
it is probably wrong.
