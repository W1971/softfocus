title: "SoftFocus Project Meta-Freeze"
version: v1.0
date: 2026-01-24
status: SEALED
scope: PROJECT_WIDE
---

## Purpose

This document formally seals the current state of the SoftFocus project.

It establishes immutable boundaries across:
- Phase A (Observation)
- Mobile v1 (Result UI)
- v2 (Design-only exploration)

No further execution, expansion, or reinterpretation is permitted
outside explicitly defined future governance gates.

---

## Sealed Domains

### 1. Phase A — Observation-Only (SEALED)

**Status:** FINAL  
**Execution:** ❌ Forbidden  
**Action framing:** ❌ Forbidden  

Phase A is locked as a *pure observation layer*.

It:
- does not instruct
- does not recommend
- does not guide action
- does not imply next steps

Any language implying action, remediation, optimization, or progression
violates this seal.

Reference:
- Phase A Observation-Only Gate (CI enforced)

---

### 2. Mobile v1 — Result Surface (SEALED)

**Status:** FINAL  
**UI Scope:** Mobile-only  
**Interaction:** None required  

Mobile v1 is locked as:
- an orientation surface
- a non-interactive result presentation
- a zero-pressure interface

It explicitly forbids:
- CTAs
- metrics
- progress indicators
- recommendations
- behavioral prompts

All Mobile v1 constraints are immutable.

Reference:
- Mobile UI Audit
- Mobile v1 Governance Freeze

---

### 3. v2 — DESIGN_ONLY (SEALED)

**Status:** DESIGN_ONLY  
**Implementation:** ❌ Forbidden  
**UI:** ❌ Forbidden  
**CI execution paths:** ❌ Forbidden  

SoftFocus v2 is sealed as a **conceptual and analytical layer only**.

Permitted:
- definitions
- theoretical framing
- explanatory language

Forbidden:
- implementation plans
- runtime paths
- frontend or backend execution
- UI references
- productivity framing

No document, roadmap, or alias may authorize execution.

Reference:
- V2 Approval Gate
- v2 DESIGN_ONLY CI gate

---

## Governance Hierarchy

This document has **higher authority** than:
- roadmaps
- plans
- execution specs
- implementation notes

Any conflict must be resolved by **rejecting the conflicting change**.

---

## Modification Policy

This document:
- ❌ cannot be edited
- ❌ cannot be superseded
- ❌ cannot be partially relaxed

The only valid way forward is:
1. a new governance phase
2. a new approval gate
3. explicit CI enforcement
4. a new freeze document

---

## Final Declaration

Phase A is complete.  
Mobile v1 is final.  
v2 is design-only.

No execution is authorized beyond these boundaries.

This seal is absolute.
