# SoftFocus — Regulatory Language Compliance Review (EU / US)

## Status
Type: compliance-reference  
Scope: enterprise deployment  
Audience: Legal, Compliance, Procurement

---

## Classification

SoftFocus qualifies as:

- an analytical information system,
- a decision-support orientation tool,
- a non-clinical assessment platform.

It does **not** qualify as:
- a medical device,
- a diagnostic system,
- a therapeutic service,
- a mental health application.

---

## EU Regulatory Alignment

### Medical Device Regulation (MDR, EU)

SoftFocus does not meet MDR criteria because it:

- does not diagnose disease,
- does not monitor medical conditions,
- does not provide therapeutic recommendations,
- does not influence clinical decision-making.

SoftFocus outputs are descriptive and informational only.

---

### GDPR / Data Protection

SoftFocus B2B deployments:
- rely on anonymized, aggregated data,
- avoid individual profiling,
- do not process special category health data
  as defined under GDPR Article 9.

Individual results, where present, are self-accessed
and not shared with employers.

---

## US Regulatory Alignment

### FDA (SaMD)

SoftFocus does not qualify as Software as a Medical Device because it:

- does not provide diagnosis or treatment,
- does not recommend medical actions,
- does not claim health outcomes,
- does not support clinical decision-making.

Outputs are framed as operational risk indicators only.

---

### Employment & Workplace Safety

SoftFocus:
- is not a performance evaluation tool,
- does not score individuals for HR actions,
- does not trigger employment decisions.

It is designed to inform organizational awareness,
not personnel management.

---

## Language Constraints (Enforced)

SoftFocus documentation and UI:

- avoid clinical claims,
- avoid improvement promises,
- avoid urgency framing,
- avoid behavioral prescriptions.

All references to burnout, recovery, or fatigue
are analytical abstractions, not health claims.

---

## Conclusion

SoftFocus is safe to deploy in EU and US enterprise contexts
as a non-clinical analytical system,
when used according to documented governance constraints.
