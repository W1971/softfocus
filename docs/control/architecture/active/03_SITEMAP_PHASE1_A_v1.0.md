Version: v1.0  
Status: ACTIVE

## Purpose

This sitemap reflects the canonical structure
of the SoftFocus platform after locking
Phase 1 and Phase A.

It is a structural map, not a navigation proposal.

---

---

## Level 1 — Core Assessment

---

## Level 3 — Structured Protocol

- Overview of structured intervention
- Access gated by assessment completion

---

## Level 4 — Programmatic SEO (Entry Layer)

/en/burnout-test-for/{audience}
- Audience-specific context only
- Identical structure
- Single assessment entry point

Examples:
- /en/burnout-test-for/developers
- /en/burnout-test-for/founders

- Platform philosophy
- Scope and non-goals

## Navigation Principle

Navigation reflects responsibility, not engagement:

1. Assessment
2. Understanding
3. Context
4. Intervention

---

## Summary

The sitemap enforces a single product narrative:
assessment first, explanation second,
intervention last.

All roads lead through the assessment.
