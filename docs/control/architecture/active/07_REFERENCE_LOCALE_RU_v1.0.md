# SoftFocus — Reference Locale: Russian (RU)

Version: v1.0  
Status: ACTIVE  

---

## Purpose

This document establishes Russian (RU)
as the reference locale for SoftFocus content.

All other localizations are derived from RU.

---

## Definition

The reference locale is the authoritative source
for meaning, structure, and terminology.

RU content defines:

- semantic intent
- terminology boundaries
- sentence structure
- explanatory tone

---

## Implications

- RU content is written first
- All translations must preserve RU structure
- No locale may introduce new meaning
- No locale may simplify or reinterpret content

---

## Prohibited Actions

- using EN as semantic reference
- cultural rewriting
- localization-driven UX changes
- content divergence between locales

---

## Allowed Actions

- direct translation
- grammatical adaptation
- script direction changes (e.g. RTL)

Meaning must remain identical.

---

## Enforcement

Localization scripts and reviewers
must treat RU as immutable reference.

Any conflict is resolved in favor of RU.

---

## Summary

RU is the semantic backbone of SoftFocus.

Localization expands access,
not authorship.
