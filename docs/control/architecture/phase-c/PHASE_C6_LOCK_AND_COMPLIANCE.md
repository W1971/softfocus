Version: v1.0  
Status: LOCKED  
Phase: C  
Step: 6  
Audience: Maintainers, auditors

## Purpose

This document formally **locks Phase C**
and declares compliance with governance rules
and the SoftFocus Platform Manifest.

No implementation is introduced here.

---

## Scope of Phase C

Phase C consists exclusively of the following steps:

- C-1: Neutral Paid Boundary Specification
- C-2: Paid Access Taxonomy
- C-3: Paid Boundary Enforcement Rules
- C-4: Audit & Logging Rules for Paid Access
- C-5: Failure Modes & Safe Defaults
- C-6: Lock & Compliance Declaration

No additional documents are part of Phase C.

---

## Compliance Declaration

Phase C is compliant with the following invariants:

- assessment logic remains immutable;
- scoring and classification remain unchanged;
- result interpretation remains unchanged;
- base access (Class 0) remains unconditional;
- no UX, copy, pricing, or persuasion is defined;
- monetization boundaries are formal and neutral.

---

## Governance Confirmation

By this declaration:

- Phase C is marked as LOCKED;
- any modification to Phase C documents is forbidden;
- extensions require a new phase or governance approval;
- CI and audit systems may treat Phase C as immutable.

---

## Audit Readiness

All Phase C documents are:

- versioned;
- structure-locked;
- internally consistent;
- compatible with EN↔RU parity rules.

Phase C is ready for audit review.

---

## Transition Rule

No subsequent phase may begin unless:

- Phase C is LOCKED;
- this declaration exists;
- governance checks pass.

---

## Final Statement

Phase C defines **how monetization may exist**
without altering **what SoftFocus is**.

With this declaration,
Phase C is formally complete and closed.
