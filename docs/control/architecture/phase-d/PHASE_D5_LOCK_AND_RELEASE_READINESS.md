Version: v1.0  
Status: LOCKED  
Phase: D  
Step: 5  
Audience: Maintainers, auditors

---

## Purpose

This document formally **locks Phase D**
and declares **release readiness at the governance level**.

No automation, CI, or publication is enabled here.

---

## Scope of Phase D

Phase D includes the following steps:

- D-0: Release & Distribution Kickoff
- D-1: Release Definition & Tagging Rules
- D-2: Distribution Channels Specification
- D-3: Indexing & Discoverability Rules
- D-4: Release Audit Artifacts Specification
- D-5: Lock & Release Readiness Declaration

No other documents are part of Phase D.

---

## Readiness Declaration

By this declaration, the project confirms that:

- release identification is tag-based and immutable;
- distribution channels are explicitly defined;
- indexing is opt-in and reversible;
- audit artifacts are mandatory and verifiable;
- governance enforcement scripts exist for Phase D-3 and D-4;
- no Platform Manifest principles are violated.

---

## Lock Effect

With this document in place:

- Phase D is marked as LOCKED;
- changes to Phase D rules are forbidden;
- implementation of release automation is permitted;
- release execution remains gated by governance checks.

---

## Audit Readiness

Phase D is:

- internally consistent;
- fully documented;
- reproducible from a tagged commit;
- ready for independent audit.

---

## Transition Rule

No further specification changes to Phase D are allowed.

Subsequent work must occur in a new phase
focused on implementation and operations.

---

## Final Statement

Phase D defines **how SoftFocus may be released and discovered**
without changing **what SoftFocus is**.

With this declaration,
Phase D is complete, locked, and release-ready.
