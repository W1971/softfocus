# Phase C — Monetization Gate

## Purpose

This gate prevents premature monetization
of analytical products without sufficient clarity and safeguards.

## Required Artifacts

Before monetization is allowed, the following MUST be approved:

- PAID_PRODUCT_PAGE.md
- PRODUCT_VALUE_STATEMENT.md
- REFUND_AND_EXPECTATION_POLICY.md
- Confirmation that only ONE product is monetized

## Blocking Rule

If any required artifact is missing or in DRAFT status,
production release is BLOCKED.

Manual overrides are not permitted.
