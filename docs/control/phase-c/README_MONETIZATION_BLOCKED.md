# Why Monetization Is Blocked

Monetization is intentionally disabled.

Reasons:
- Phase C governance requires explicit approval.
- Dry-run must be completed and recorded.
- Approval must be documented and auditable.
- Revocation is supported and immediate.

This is not a technical limitation.
This is a governance decision.

Until all required records are present and valid,
monetization MUST remain disabled.
