# Internal Link Map — 5 Canonical Pillars (RU)

## Purpose

Build a deterministic internal-link cluster across 5 canonical pillars:
- no marketing CTA
- no “read more” framing
- purely explanatory transitions

This map is intended for controlled content wiring.

## Canonical Nodes

A — Recovery ≠ Rest  
- /guides/vosstanovlenie-ne-ravno-otdyhu  
- /guides/kogda-pauzy-ne-snizhayut-nagruzku

B — Sleep ≠ Recovery  
- /son-ne-raven-vosstanovleniyu  
- /kogda-son-ne-pomogaet

C — Compensation Instead of Recovery  
- /guides/kompensaciya-vmesto-vosstanovleniya

D — Decision Density as Load Driver (implicit for now)  
- expressed through A + B

E — Burnout as an Operational State  
- /en/tests/burnout-test  
- calculators as reference surfaces

## Recommended Link Graph (Explanatory)

### A → B
Context:
“Sleep is often assumed to close recovery automatically. In practice it may not.”

Link target:
- /son-ne-raven-vosstanovleniyu

---

### B → C
Context:
“When recovery does not close, the system transitions into compensation.”

Link target:
- /guides/kompensaciya-vmesto-vosstanovleniya

---

### C → E
Context:
“In compensation mode, burnout forms as an operational state, not an event.”

Link target:
- /en/tests/burnout-test

---

### E → A (closure)
Context:
“A common failure mode is trying to compensate load with rest rather than recovery.”

Link target:
- /guides/vosstanovlenie-ne-ravno-otdyhu

---

## Calculator Reference (Non-CTA)

### B → Sleep Calculator
Context:
“SoftFocus evaluates whether recovery closes under current load, without norms or recommendations.”

Link target:
- /kalkulyator-sna

---

## Enforcement Notes

- Links must be framed as logical continuation, not navigation.
- Keep tone analytical, neutral, non-clinical.
- Avoid “you should”, “do this next”, “recommended actions”.
