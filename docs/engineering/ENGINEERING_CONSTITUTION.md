# SoftFocus — Engineering Constitution

## Purpose
Define non-negotiable engineering rules that protect trust, safety,
and scalability of the SoftFocus platform.

## Core Rules
1. Source of truth stays clean.
2. Secrets never enter git history.
3. Content quality is enforced by code.
4. SEO is distribution, not concept creation.
5. Assessment logic is language-agnostic.
6. Production content is English-first.
7. No dark patterns, no urgency, no motivation framing.

## Governance
- Validators are mandatory.
- CI gates are authoritative.
- Manual overrides are forbidden.

## Failure Handling
If a rule is violated:
- Fix the system, not the symptom.
- Add automation to prevent recurrence.

## Principle
Clarity over comfort.
Structure over inspiration.
Consistency over speed.
