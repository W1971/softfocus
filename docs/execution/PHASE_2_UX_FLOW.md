# Phase 2 — UX Flow Lock

**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Scope:** System-wide UX and navigation  
**Mutability:** Frozen after approval

---

## Purpose

This document defines the only allowed user flow
through the SoftFocus system.

It exists to:
- prevent accidental guidance framing
- avoid step-based user journeys
- keep interpretation mandatory and central

Any UX or navigation decision
must comply with this flow.

## Canonical User Flow (Frozen)

pSEO Entry (role + locale)
        ↓
Unified Burnout Assessment
        ↓
Canonical Interpretation Layer (mandatory)
        ↓
Optional Analytical Depth (Calculators)

---

## Flow Principles

### 1. Entry is contextual, not directive
- pSEO pages describe load structure
- They do not promise outcomes
- They do not suggest actions

### 2. Assessment is unified
- One burnout assessment
- Identical logic for all roles and languages
- Role affects framing, not scoring

### 3. Interpretation is mandatory
- Users must see interpretation after results
- No direct jumps from test to calculators
- No bypass via navigation or deep links

### 4. Calculators are optional depth
- Calculators are analytical lenses
- They are not presented as “next step”
- They do not follow automatically from the test

---

## Forbidden UX Patterns

The following are not allowed anywhere in the system:

- Step-based navigation (“Step 1 / Step 2”)
- “What to do next” framing
- Progress or improvement language
- CTAs implying change or recovery
- Calculator links framed as continuation

---

## Allowed Navigation Patterns

- Neutral links (“Assessment”, “Explanation”, “Model”)
- Contextual cross-links inside interpretation
- Language switch without logic change

---

## Interpretation Authority

If any UX element conflicts with this document,
this document is authoritative.

Implementation must be corrected.

---

## Exit Condition

This UX flow is considered locked when:
- all entry pages comply
- assessment always resolves into interpretation
- calculators are reachable only as optional analysis

After that point,
UX flow is treated as operational and frozen.
