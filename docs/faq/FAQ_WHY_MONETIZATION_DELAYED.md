# FAQ — Why Monetization Was Not Enabled Earlier

## Was monetization technically blocked?
No.

Monetization has always been technically possible.
The restriction is **governance-based**, not engineering-based.

---

## Why delay monetization at all?
Because the product operates in a sensitive domain:
cognitive load, burnout signals, recovery capacity.

Errors here are more expensive than early revenue.

---

## Did you lose money by waiting?
We avoided:
- refunds and disputes
- regulatory ambiguity
- reputation damage
- misaligned user expectations

This was a deliberate trade-off.

---

## Is this a beta or experiment?
No.

This is a **production system**
operating under explicit governance constraints.

---

## When can monetization be enabled?
Within **24 hours**, if:
- dry-run is completed and passes
- approval is explicitly recorded
- governance gates remain green

---

## Can monetization be revoked?
Yes.

Revocation is immediate, explicit, and documented.
This is a first-class capability, not an afterthought.

---

## What does this say about the team?
That we optimize for **long-term trust and control**,
not short-term revenue optics.
