Version: v1.0  
Status: ACTIVE

---

## Why People Share SoftFocus

People share SoftFocus because:

- it does not label them,
- it does not expose weakness,
- it sounds intelligent when forwarded.

---

## Share-Safe Language Rules

Results must be:

- descriptive, not prescriptive,
- impersonal in tone,
- safe to read by peers.

---

## Trust Reinforcement

Every assessment must clearly state:

- this is not a diagnosis,
- results are context-dependent,
- reassessment is expected.

---

## Reputation Protection

SoftFocus must never become:

- a meme test,
- a viral personality quiz,
- a mental health badge.

---

## Brand Outcome

SoftFocus should be referred to as:

> “That assessment that actually made sense.”
