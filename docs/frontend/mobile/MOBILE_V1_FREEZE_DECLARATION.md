# Mobile v1 — Design Freeze Declaration

## Status

**ACTIVE — Mobile v1 is frozen.**

This declaration formally freezes the Mobile v1 user experience
for the SoftFocus system.

---

## Scope of Freeze

The following elements are frozen and MUST NOT change
without an explicit version upgrade:

- Mobile result screen structure
- Mobile result content order
- Mobile language tone and framing
- Mobile interaction model
- Mobile anti-requirements
- Mobile policy constraints
- Mobile result schema

---

## What Is Explicitly Frozen

- No new screens
- No new interactions
- No calls to action
- No personalization
- No engagement mechanics
- No reminders or notifications
- No UI experiments or A/B tests

Mobile v1 is an orientation surface only.

---

## What Is Allowed During Freeze

The following changes are permitted **without breaking the freeze**:

- Text clarification without semantic change
- Bug-level corrections that reduce cognitive load
- Removal of elements that violate mobile policy
- Documentation clarifications

No change may introduce:
- urgency
- motivation
- instruction
- conversion pressure

---

## Change Protocol

Any change to Mobile v1 requires:

1. Written rationale
2. Explicit governance approval
3. Version upgrade (v1 → v2)
4. Updated audit checklist

Changes without this process are invalid.

---

## Purpose of Freeze

The freeze exists to:

- protect cognitive simplicity
- preserve user trust
- prevent feature creep
- ensure interpretive stability

Mobile v1 is considered **complete**
when it no longer requires attention.
