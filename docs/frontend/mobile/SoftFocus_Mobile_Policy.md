# SoftFocus Mobile Policy

## Scope

This policy defines the mobile-only result screen behavior
for the SoftFocus system.

It does not apply to desktop UI.

---

## Core principle

The mobile result screen is an orientation surface,
not an action surface.

It must reduce cognitive pressure,
not introduce decisions.

---

## Required structure (top to bottom)

1. Result State  
   - label (state name)
   - short neutral descriptor

2. Context  
   - always visible
   - non-clinical
   - non-evaluative

3. Excerpt  
   - explains meaning
   - no instructions
   - no steps

4. Reference Link  
   - optional
   - secondary
   - non-CTA

5. Neutral Close (optional)

---

## Layout constraints

- Single vertical column
- No tabs
- No side elements
- No collapsible primary content

---

## Visibility rules

- Result State, Context, and Excerpt
  MUST be visible without scrolling
  on a standard mobile viewport.

---

## Interaction rules

- No required interaction
- No forced navigation
- No blocking modals

---

## Success criteria

The screen is successful if:
- it can be read in under 20 seconds
- it does not trigger “what should I do now?”
- it does not increase urgency or pressure
