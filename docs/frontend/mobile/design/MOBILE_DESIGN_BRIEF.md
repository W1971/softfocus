# SoftFocus Mobile Design Brief (v1)

Status: ACTIVE  
Scope: Mobile v1  
Audience: Product Designer  
Constraint Level: HARD

---

## Product Essence

SoftFocus is an orientation tool, not a productivity app.

The mobile experience must feel:
- calm
- minimal
- obvious
- finished

If something needs explanation, it does not belong on the screen.

---

## Core Design Principle

**Orientation, not action.**

The screen must answer:
“What state am I in?”

It must NOT answer:
“What should I do?”

---

## What the user experiences

- No numbers
- No scores
- No charts
- No progress
- No pressure

The result appears fully formed.
Nothing asks for attention.

---

## Visual Language

- Single column
- Generous spacing
- One primary text block
- One secondary context block
- Optional quiet reference link

No UI chrome that suggests interaction.

---

## Emotional Quality

- Neutral
- Respectful
- Non-alarmist
- Non-motivational

The product does not push.
It stands still.

---

## Absolute Constraints

If violated, the design FAILS audit:

- Any call to action
- Any urgency
- Any “implied progression”
- Any scroll required to understand the result

---

## Design Definition of Done

A first-time user:
- understands the result in <20 seconds
- does not ask “what now?”
- does not feel judged
