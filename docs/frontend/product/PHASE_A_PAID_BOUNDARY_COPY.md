# SoftFocus — Phase A: Paid Boundary Copy

Status: LOCKED  
Scope: Access Framing  
Version: v1.0

---

## Purpose

This document defines the only allowed copy
used at the boundary between free assessment
and access to the structured protocol.

The goal is clarity, not conversion.

---

## Core Principle

Access is framed as:
- access to structure
- not access to help
- not access to support
- not access to guidance

---

## Canonical Access Text

> The assessment describes your current state and its mechanisms.  
>  
> For cases where burnout signals are persistent,  
> a structured intervention framework is available,  
> focused on load and recovery as a system.

---
