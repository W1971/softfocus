# SoftFocus — Phase A: Structured Protocol

Status: ACTIVE  
Scope: Post-Assessment Intervention  
Version: v1.0

---

## Purpose

Phase A defines the structured protocol layer of SoftFocus.

The protocol exists to provide a coherent, system-level response
to persistent burnout signals identified in Phase 1.

It is not advice, not coaching, and not therapy.
It is a structured intervention framework.

---

## Relationship to Phase 1

The protocol is only meaningful in context of the assessment.

- Assessment identifies the state
- Result explains the mechanisms
- Protocol addresses the structure of load and recovery

The protocol does not override or reinterpret assessment results.
It extends them.

---

## When the Protocol Applies

The structured protocol is relevant when:

- burnout signals are persistent
- recovery capacity is reduced
- rest alone no longer restores baseline functioning

The protocol is optional.
Its presentation is contextual, not directive.

---

## What the Protocol Is

The structured protocol is:

- mechanism-focused
- system-oriented
- time-bounded
- non-emotional
- non-motivational

It works with:
- cognitive load
- recovery capacity
- functional boundaries

---

## What the Protocol Is Not

The protocol does NOT include:

- personalized advice
- behavioral prescriptions
- lifestyle recommendations
- emotional processing
- goal setting
- habit building
- motivational framing

---

## Core Protocol Principles

### 1. Structure Over Effort

Recovery is treated as a structural problem,
not a matter of willpower or motivation.

---

### 2. Load and Recovery as a System

Cognitive load and recovery capacity
are treated as interacting variables.

Changing one without the other
does not resolve burnout.

---

### 3. Stabilization Before Optimization

The protocol prioritizes stabilization
of load and recovery cycles.

Optimization is explicitly excluded.

---

### 4. Minimalism

The protocol introduces
the minimum necessary structure.

No accumulation of practices.
No layered routines.

---

## Protocol Layers

The protocol is composed of three layers.

Each layer addresses a specific structural dimension.

---

### Layer 1 — Load Stabilization

**Purpose:**  
Prevent further accumulation of cognitive load.

**Focus:**  
- containment, not reduction
- predictability, not efficiency

**Outcome:**  
Load stops increasing.

---

### Layer 2 — Recovery Re-Enablement

**Purpose:**  
Restore the functional effectiveness of recovery.

**Focus:**  
- recovery quality
- recovery timing
- recovery boundaries

**Outcome:**  
Recovery produces measurable relief.

---

### Layer 3 — Functional Recalibration

**Purpose:**  
Align functional output with sustainable capacity.

**Focus:**  
- output expectations
- cognitive pacing
- boundary clarity

**Outcome:**  
Effort and result are realigned.

---

## Time Framing

The protocol is framed as a finite intervention.

It is not an ongoing practice.
It is not a lifestyle.

The intent is exit, not retention.

---

## User Positioning

The user is treated as:

- competent
- autonomous
- capable of understanding mechanisms

The protocol does not “guide” the user.
It provides structure for informed action.

---

## Language and Tone

The protocol uses:

- neutral language
- explanatory framing
- system-level descriptions

It avoids:
- encouragement
- reassurance
- urgency
- promises

---

## Boundary With Paid Access

The protocol may be offered as a paid resource.

The payment boundary is framed as access to structure,
not access to help.

No guarantees.
No outcomes promised.

---

## Relationship to Future Phases

Future phases may:

- expand protocol depth
- add format variations (PDF, app)
- localize content

They must not:
- alter core principles
- introduce motivational framing
- contradict Phase 1 assessment logic

---

## Phase A Status

Phase A defines the intervention logic layer.

It is complete when:
- its structure is fixed
- its principles are locked
- its relationship to assessment is unambiguous
