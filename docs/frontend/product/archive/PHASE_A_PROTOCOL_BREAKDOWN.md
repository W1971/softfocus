# SoftFocus — Phase A: Protocol Breakdown

Status: LOCKED  
Scope: Structured Intervention Modules  
Version: v1.0

---

## Purpose

This document defines how the structured protocol
is decomposed into clear, non-prescriptive modules.

Modules are not steps or instructions.
They are structural components addressing system-level mechanisms.

---

## Design Principle

Each module:
- addresses one structural dimension
- does not prescribe behavior
- can be understood independently
- does not require completion tracking

Modules describe *what is being worked on*, not *how this is interpreted*.

---

## Module Structure (Canonical)

Each module contains:

1. Structural focus  
2. Mechanism explanation  
3. Boundary clarification  

No tasks.
No exercises.
No checklists.

---

## Module 1 — Cognitive Load Containment

### Structural focus
Limiting further accumulation of cognitive load.

### Mechanism
Persistent load prevents the nervous system
from entering recovery-supportive states.

Containment reduces background cognitive pressure.

### Boundary
This module does not attempt to reduce workload.
It prevents uncontrolled expansion.

---

## Module 2 — Recovery Reactivation

### Structural focus
Restoring the functional effect of recovery.

### Mechanism
When recovery is ineffective,
rest no longer produces relief.

Reactivation focuses on timing and separation,
not duration.

### Boundary
This module does not optimize rest.
It restores baseline effectiveness.

---

## Module 3 — Functional Boundary Reset

### Structural focus
Clarifying where effort begins and ends.

### Mechanism
Blurred boundaries cause continuous partial engagement,
blocking recovery cycles.

Resetting boundaries restores system contrast.

### Boundary
This module does not enforce limits.
It defines structural separation.

---

## Module 4 — Output Recalibration

### Structural focus
Aligning output expectations with sustainable capacity.

### Mechanism
Mismatch between effort and expected output
accelerates functional exhaustion.

Recalibration restores proportionality.

### Boundary
This module does not maximize productivity.
It restores functional coherence.

---

## Module Independence

Modules are:
- non-linear
- non-progressive
- non-hierarchical

They form a structural map, not a journey.

---

## Status

Protocol Breakdown is complete.
Modules are fixed for Phase A.
