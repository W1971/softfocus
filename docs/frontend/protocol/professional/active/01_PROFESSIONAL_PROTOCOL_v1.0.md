# Professional Burnout Stabilization Protocol

This protocol extends the Structured Recovery Protocol
for professional operating environments.

It applies when:
- load cannot be paused
- responsibility remains active
- recovery must occur without disengagement

It prioritizes containment and risk reduction
over performance recovery or optimization.
