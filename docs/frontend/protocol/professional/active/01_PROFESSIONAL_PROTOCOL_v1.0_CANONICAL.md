# Professional Burnout Stabilization Protocol

This protocol extends the Structured Recovery Protocol
for professional operating environments where:

- responsibility cannot be paused
- decision density remains high
- recovery must occur without disengagement

It prioritizes containment and risk reduction
over optimization or performance recovery.

This protocol does not replace the core protocol.
It assumes familiarity with its concepts and limits.
