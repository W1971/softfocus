# The Research Foundations Behind the SoftFocus Assessment

Version: v1.0  
Status: ACTIVE  
Audience: Public  
Purpose: Methodology clarity & trust

## What “Informed by Professional Research” Means

When we say that the SoftFocus assessment is
**informed by established professional research**,
we mean that its structure, questions, and interpretation logic
are grounded in **well-documented ways professionals lose performance sustainability over time**.

We do not apply clinical diagnostics.
We apply **operational thinking**.

The assessment draws from four well-established research areas.

---

## 1. Occupational Burnout Research (Non-Clinical)

This body of research studies how **long-term work conditions**
affect performance, engagement, and sustainability.

Key insights we use:

- burnout develops gradually, not suddenly;
- people often compensate for fatigue to maintain output;
- recovery can appear present while being ineffective;
- early warning signs are structural, not emotional.

How this informs the assessment:

- we look for effort–recovery imbalance,
- we identify compensation patterns,
- we classify stages based on sustainability, not mood.

Important boundary:
We do **not** use clinical diagnostic criteria
and do not assess mental health conditions.

## 2. Human Factors & Cognitive Load Research

Human factors research examines how people perform
in **complex, high-load environments** such as aviation,
engineering, medicine, and control systems.

Key insights we use:

- decision quality degrades under sustained cognitive load;
- attention becomes fragmented before performance visibly drops;
- errors often appear late, after long compensation;
- fatigue reduces cognitive margin, not just energy.

How this informs the assessment:

- questions focus on decision effort and attention stability;
- we treat burnout risk as a performance reliability issue;
- we avoid emotional self-reporting.

This approach is standard in safety-critical industries.

## 3. Systems & Reliability Thinking

Systems and reliability research studies how failures
emerge in complex systems over time.

Key insights we use:

- failures rarely come from a single cause;
- early signals are often subtle and ignored;
- compensation can hide problems temporarily;
- focusing on lagging indicators misses real risk.

How this informs the assessment:

- we analyze patterns, not isolated answers;
- we focus on leading indicators of degradation;
- we treat burnout risk as a structural drift problem.

This is why the assessment avoids simple scores
and instead identifies dominant risk vectors.

---

## 4. Longitudinal Assessment Principles

Longitudinal assessment focuses on **change over time**
rather than one-off measurements.

Key insights we use:

- the same conditions produce the same outcomes;
- meaningful trends require time separation;
- comparisons should explain change, not judge it;
- gamified scoring distorts interpretation.

How this informs the assessment:

- reassessment is conditional, not encouraged constantly;
- results are comparable without “progress bars”;
- paid reports include time-based scenarios.

---

## Why These Four Together Matter

Individually, each research area explains part of the problem.
Together, they explain why:

- professionals often “feel fine” while degrading,
- burnout risk is missed until it becomes costly,
- recovery advice alone is insufficient,
- performance collapses appear sudden but are not.

SoftFocus integrates these perspectives
into a single, non-clinical assessment framework.

---

## What This Means for You

The assessment is designed to help you understand:

- how sustainable your current performance is,
- where degradation is most likely to appear first,
- when reassessment becomes meaningful.

Not:

- how motivated you are,
- how resilient you “should be”,
- or how to “fix yourself”.

---

## Final Clarification

SoftFocus does not replace professional care.
It provides **clarity about patterns**
that are often invisible until they become expensive.
