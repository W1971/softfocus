## What SoftFocus Is

SoftFocus is a **non-clinical assessment**
that helps professionals understand
**burnout risk patterns** related to sustained cognitive work.

It focuses on:

- performance sustainability,
- decision load under fatigue,
- recovery effectiveness,
- early structural risk signals.

SoftFocus provides clarity,
not labels or judgments.

---

## What SoftFocus Is Not

SoftFocus is not:

- a medical or psychological diagnosis,
- a therapy or treatment tool,
- a personality test,
- a productivity optimization system,
- a motivational or coaching program.

---

## Why This Distinction Matters

By staying non-clinical, SoftFocus remains:

- safe to use at work,
- safe to share,
- non-stigmatizing,
- focused on awareness rather than intervention.

---

## In One Sentence

SoftFocus helps answer:
**“How sustainable is my current way of working?”**
