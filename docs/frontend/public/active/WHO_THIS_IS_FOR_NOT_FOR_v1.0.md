# Who SoftFocus Is For — And Who It Is Not For

Version: v1.0  
Status: ACTIVE  
Audience: Public  
Purpose: Boundary clarity

## Who SoftFocus Is For

SoftFocus is designed for people who:

- perform sustained cognitive work,
- make decisions under responsibility,
- maintain performance over long periods,
- want clarity without labels or diagnoses.

Common examples include:

- developers and engineers,
- managers and team leads,
- founders and executives,
- analysts and consultants,
- healthcare and safety-critical professionals.

---

## Who SoftFocus Is Not For

SoftFocus may not be appropriate if you are:

- seeking a medical or psychological diagnosis,
- looking for therapy or treatment recommendations,
- experiencing acute mental health distress,
- interested in motivational coaching or self-help programs.

In such cases, professional clinical support is important.

## Why This Boundary Exists

SoftFocus stays non-clinical so it can be:

- safe to use at work,
- safe to share,
- focused on awareness rather than judgment.

This boundary protects both users and organizations.

## In Simple Terms

SoftFocus is for understanding **risk and sustainability** —
not for fixing, diagnosing, or labeling people.
