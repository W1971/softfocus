# SoftFocus v2 — Design Brief (DESIGN ONLY)

Status: DESIGN_ONLY  
Audience: External designer  
Scope: Visual language, UX tone, interaction principles  
Implementation: NOT ALLOWED

---

## 1. What SoftFocus Is (for design)

SoftFocus is not a productivity app.
It is not a wellness app.
It is not a dashboard.

SoftFocus is an **orientation surface**.

The design must feel:
- calm
- sparse
- deliberate
- intellectually respectful

No visual pressure.
No encouragement to act.
No “better version of you”.

---

## 2. Core Design Principle

> **Clarity without activation**

If the design makes the user want to *do something immediately*,
it is wrong.

If the design helps the user *see their state more clearly*,
it is correct.

---

## 3. Emotional Tone

Allowed:
- neutral
- quiet
- analytical
- composed
- slightly distant

Forbidden:
- motivational
- energetic
- friendly-cheerful
- alarming
- therapeutic

The product should feel:
> “This understands my situation without trying to change me.”

---

## 4. Visual Language

### Typography
- Primary: humanist or modern serif
- Secondary: neutral sans-serif
- No playful fonts
- No condensed or aggressive weights

### Color
- Muted palette
- Low contrast
- No reds, greens, success/failure colors
- Avoid color-as-feedback

### Layout
- Single column
- Strong vertical rhythm
- Large margins
- Breathing space is mandatory

---

## 5. Interaction Rules

- No gamification
- No progress bars
- No completion states
- No calls to action
- No “next steps”

The interface must never ask:
> “What should I do now?”

---

## 6. Mobile Priority

Mobile is not a smaller desktop.

Mobile is:
- shorter
- calmer
- more final

Everything important must be visible **without scrolling**.

---

## 7. What the Designer Must NOT Do

- Invent features
- Add UI logic
- Propose flows
- Suggest engagement mechanics
- “Improve conversion”

Design is **representation**, not intervention.

---

## 8. Output Expected

- Visual direction
- Component mood
- Typography + color samples
- Example result screen (static)

No prototypes.
No interactions.
No animations.

---

## Final Check

If the design feels:
- “beautiful but quiet” → correct
- “helpful and motivating” → incorrect
- “I should take action” → invalid
