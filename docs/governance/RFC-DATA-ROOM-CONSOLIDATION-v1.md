# RFC — Data Room Consolidation

## Purpose

This RFC formally links investor-facing materials
to the governance framework of SoftFocus.

It ensures that all external narratives
are grounded in canonical internal controls.

---

## Included Artifacts

The following documents are recognized
as governance-aligned investor materials:

- data-room/DATA_ROOM_INDEX.md
- docs/investor/INVESTOR_VERBAL_SCRIPT_ONE_PAGE.md
- docs/faq/FAQ_WHY_MONETIZATION_DELAYED.md
- docs/review/REVIEW_PATH_10K_TO_25K.md

---

## Constraints

- These documents MUST NOT promise revenue
- These documents MUST NOT override governance gates
- Monetization remains blocked unless explicitly approved

---

## Enforcement

Any investor communication referencing monetization
must align with this RFC.

Deviation requires a new RFC.

---

## Status

Accepted.
