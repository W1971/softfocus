# Documentation Active Scope Invariant (Phase C+)

Active documentation includes:

- overview and project entry docs
- governance and control
- frontend, product, mobile
- metrics and operations
- release documentation

Business, investor, roadmap, and narrative documents
are excluded from active execution scope and must be archived.

This invariant is enforced via CI starting Phase C Maintenance.
