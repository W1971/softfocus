# RFC: Phase D Initialization

**RFC ID:** RFC-PHASE-D-INIT  
**Status:** DRAFT  
**Previous Phase:** Phase C (Maintenance)  
**Baseline:** phase-c-audit-handoff  
**Author:** SoftFocus Governance  
**Severity:** HIGH

---

## 1. Purpose

This RFC formally initializes Phase D of SoftFocus.

Phase D represents **intentional expansion** beyond
maintenance-only constraints of Phase C.

No Phase D work may begin until this RFC is approved.

---

## 2. Phase C Recap (Context)

Phase C established:
- deterministic governance
- audit-ready documentation
- strict UI non-interpretation
- frozen analytical core
- explicit exclusion of paid scope

Phase D must preserve these guarantees unless explicitly relaxed.

---

## 3. What Phase D MAY Introduce

Subject to approval:
- reintroduction of paid scope
- new analytical artifacts (separate from v1 core)
- additional calculators or assessments
- new distribution surfaces

All additions require explicit RFCs.

---

## 4. What Phase D MUST NOT Break

Unless superseded by RFC:
- non-clinical positioning
- deterministic scoring cores
- canonical terminology
- auditability of logic and content

---

## 5. Governance Model (Phase D)

Phase D uses:
- RFC-first development
- explicit scope declarations
- staged approval (D1 → D2 → D3)
- rollback guarantees to Phase C baseline

---

## 6. Exit Criteria (Draft)

Phase D exits when:
- at least one new scope is validated
- monetization or expansion is justified
- governance load remains manageable

---

## 7. Next Required RFCs

- RFC-PHASE-D-SCOPE
- RFC-PAID-SCOPE-REINTRODUCTION (if applicable)
- RFC-NEW-ANALYTICAL-AXIS (if applicable)

---

## Summary

Phase D is optional and intentional.
Its purpose is expansion **without erosion**
of the guarantees achieved in Phase C.
