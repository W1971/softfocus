# Investor Q&A — Hard Questions

## Why not enable monetization immediately?
Because early revenue in a sensitive domain
creates irreversible trust and legal risks.

We prioritized control over optics.

---

## Are you over-engineering governance?
No.

Governance is lighter than dealing with refunds,
regulatory escalation, or reputational damage later.

---

## What if demand disappears while you wait?
We measure demand continuously via shadow signals.

If demand weakens, monetization is not justified.
That is a valid outcome.

---

## Is this a lack of confidence in the product?
No.

It is confidence in the system:
we know monetization can be enabled in 24 hours
without rework.

---

## Why not subscriptions for higher LTV?
Subscriptions introduce:
- retention pressure
- expectation of outcomes
- recurring liability

They are misaligned with a non-clinical analytical product.

---

## How do you scale without growth tactics?
By parallelization, not persuasion.

More analytical products,
same governance,
same calm decision-making.

---

## What is the biggest risk?
Misinterpretation of intent as diagnosis.

Governance exists specifically to prevent that.

---

## What convinces you monetization will work?
Shadow intent signals,
price perception testing,
and conservative confidence bands.

Not hope. Not projections.

---

## What is the exit narrative?
SoftFocus is an asset:
- stable
- governed
- monetizable on demand

It does not depend on continuous hype
to retain value.
