# SoftFocus — One-Page Verbal Script for Investors

## Positioning (Opening)

**SoftFocus is not a growth startup.  
It is a governed analytical product.**

We deliberately built a system where monetization
*can be enabled quickly*,
but *cannot be enabled accidentally*.

This is a conscious risk-management decision.

---

## What Is Already Done

- Product is **production-ready**
- Core logic is **deterministic and frozen**
- Governance is enforced in CI and release gates
- Monetization is **technically ready**, but **procedurally locked**

This is not “we are not ready”.
This is “we are ready and controlling exposure”.

---

## Why Monetization Is Still Disabled

We measure **real demand without executing payments**:
- shadow monetization signals
- price perception testing
- behavioral depth metrics

This allows us to:
- validate demand honestly
- avoid refunds and legal exposure
- protect trust in a sensitive domain

---

## Economics (Baseline)

- One-time analytical reports
- Price: ~$29
- ~$4k/month = ~140 purchases
- ~5 calm, deliberate decisions per day

No subscriptions.  
No pressure.  
No promises.

---

## Scaling Logic

We do not increase pressure or conversion tricks.

We scale by:
- adding parallel analytical products
- reusing the same engine and governance
- keeping the same non-clinical boundary

---

## Closing

**SoftFocus is an asset  
that can generate revenue,  
but first proves that it deserves to.**
