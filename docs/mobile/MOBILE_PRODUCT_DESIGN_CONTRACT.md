## Scope & Compliance Boundary

It does not introduce medical, clinical, or therapeutic behavior.

All terminology is analytical and informational only.

# SoftFocus — Mobile Product Design Contract

## Core Position

Mobile is not a companion to desktop.
Mobile is the **primary embodiment** of SoftFocus philosophy.

The mobile product must feel:
- complete,
- quiet,
- non-demanding.

---

## Mobile First Principle

On mobile, SoftFocus must work:

- without explanation,
- without onboarding,
- without repeated use expectations.

If the product requires return to be “useful”,
it violates mobile suitability.

---

## One-Screen Mental Model

Each mobile screen must satisfy **one mental operation only**:

- observe,
- orient,
- conclude.

No screen may ask the user to:
- decide next steps,
- compare options,
- plan actions.

---

## No Productivity Framing

Mobile SoftFocus must never feel like:

- a tracker,
- a habit app,
- a self-improvement tool.

Mobile is for **orientation**, not optimization.

---

## Completion Over Engagement

After receiving a result,
the user should feel:

“I understand what is happening.”

Not:
“What should I do next?”

Completion is success.
Return is optional.

---

## Hidden Depth Rule

Depth exists only behind:

- explicit user intent,
- entitlement access,
- deliberate navigation.

Mobile surfaces must not hint at “more you should explore”.

---

## Forbidden on Mobile

- push notifications
- reminders
- streaks
- daily prompts
- progress visualization
- encouragement language

---

## Summary

Mobile SoftFocus is designed
to remove pressure, not add value loops.

The best mobile experience
ends quietly.
