# docs/mobile — Reference Only

This directory is NOT canonical.

All authoritative mobile specifications live in:

→ docs/frontend/mobile/

Files here exist for:
- legacy context
- internal discussion
- historical reference

They MUST NOT:
- define policy
- define constraints
- override frontend/mobile documents

If a conflict exists,
docs/frontend/mobile/ always wins.
