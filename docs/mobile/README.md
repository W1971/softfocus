# docs/mobile — Reference Layer

This directory is **NOT canonical**.

All authoritative mobile specifications live in:

→ docs/frontend/mobile/

Files in this directory exist for:
- historical context
- internal coordination
- legacy references

They MUST NOT:
- define policy
- define constraints
- override frontend/mobile documents

If a conflict exists,
docs/frontend/mobile/ always wins.
