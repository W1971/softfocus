# SoftFocus — Mobile Design Brief (v1)

## Role of This Document

This document is an **execution bridge**.

It translates existing SoftFocus mobile governance,
policies, and constraints into a **single-page brief**
for design execution.

It introduces no new rules.

---

## Canonical References (Mandatory)

This brief must be read together with:

- docs/mobile/MOBILE_PRODUCT_DESIGN_CONTRACT.md
- docs/mobile/MOBILE_UI_INTERACTION_RULES.md
- docs/mobile/MOBILE_SCREEN_ARCHETYPES.md
- docs/frontend/mobile/SoftFocus_Mobile_Policy.md
- docs/frontend/mobile/ANTI_REQUIREMENTS_MOBILE_UI.md

If a design decision conflicts with any of the above,
the design is invalid.

---

## Product Essence (Do Not Interpret)

SoftFocus mobile is:

- not a productivity app
- not a wellbeing app
- not a habit or tracking tool

It is a **quiet analytical product**
that provides orientation without pressure.

---

## Design Objective

Design a mobile experience that feels:

- simple
- calm
- complete
- inevitable

The user should never feel guided,
motivated, or encouraged.

Understanding is the endpoint.

---

## Interaction Model

- Scroll to read
- Tap only if unavoidable
- No configuration
- No choices
- Exit is always valid

If interaction feels “engaging”,
it is wrong.

---

## Visual Discipline

- Minimal color palette
- Large negative space
- Text-first layout
- No decorative UI
- No visual hierarchy competition

Beauty must emerge from removal,
not addition.

---

## Completion Principle

After seeing a result,
the user should feel:

“I understand what is happening.”

Not:

“What should I do next?”

Completion is success.

---

## Acceptance Rule (Non-Negotiable)

A design is accepted **only if**:

- it passes `docs/mobile/audit/MOBILE_UI_AUDIT_CHECKLIST.md`
- it requires no verbal explanation
- it introduces no new UI concepts

Taste debates are out of scope.

---

## Final Note

This brief defines **constraints**, not inspiration.

If something needs to be explained,
it does not belong in the product.
