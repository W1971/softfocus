# SoftFocus — Canonical Role pSEO Template  
**(Phase D: Surface Expansion Preparation)**

---

## Context

SoftFocus has completed **Phase C**:
- analytical logic is frozen
- UX flow is locked
- operational readiness is declared

Phase D introduces **surface expansion only**.

This document defines the **only permitted template**
for adding new role-based pSEO pages
without affecting product logic,
interpretation,
or governance boundaries.

---

## Expansion Boundary (Critical)

Phase D allows:
- content-only surface expansion
- role-based contextual framing
- multilingual pSEO growth

Phase D does **not** allow:
- new analytical axes
- new interpretations
- changes to scoring or UX flow
- advisory or behavioral content

Any deviation requires an RFC
and a new system phase.

# Burnout test for {{role-label}}

## Role load context

In {{role-label}} roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained operational load
rather than isolated overwork or effort intensity.

Common load patterns include:
- {{load-pattern-1}}
- {{load-pattern-2}}
- {{load-pattern-3}}
- {{load-pattern-4}}

These patterns may persist
even when performance remains acceptable
or output appears stable.

---

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that reducing effort
or improving habits restores recovery capacity.

Under sustained load,
recovery competes with ongoing operational demands,
making effort-based correction ineffective.

Understanding load structure and recovery limits
precedes any attempt at change.

---

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained role-specific load
- emotional detachment as a compensatory or protective response
- persistence of load across time

It does not evaluate:
- skill
- competence
- motivation
- role suitability

---

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.

All terminology is analytical and informational only.
