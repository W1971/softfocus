## Scope & Compliance Boundary

This document may reference clinical terminology
**solely to clarify scope exclusion**.

SoftFocus does **not** provide diagnosis, treatment,
therapeutic services, or mental health guidance,
and is not a medical or clinical system.

All terminology is analytical and informational only.

# SoftFocus — Canonical Theory of Operation

## Status
Type: product-theory  
Scope: system-wide  
Mutability: frozen (v1.x)

---

## Purpose

This document defines how SoftFocus operates as an analytical system.

It explains **what the system measures**, **how signals are derived**,  
and **what SoftFocus explicitly does not do**.

This is a canonical reference for product, governance, legal,
and enterprise interpretation.

---

## Core Principle

SoftFocus operates on a single analytical axis:

burnout → recovery capacity → compensation

This axis does not represent a medical process.
It represents **operational sustainability under cognitive load**.

---

## Signal Model

### Burnout

Burnout in SoftFocus is an **orientation signal**.

It indicates sustained misalignment between:
- cognitive load,
- recovery capacity,
- compensatory effort.

Burnout is not treated as a diagnosis, condition, or health state.
It is an analytical marker of risk accumulation.

---

### Recovery Capacity

Recovery capacity describes the **system’s ability to restore performance
after load exposure**.

Sleep is used as a **primary observable proxy**, not as a health intervention.
Adequate sleep does not guarantee recovery.
Insufficient or unstable sleep constrains recovery capacity.

---

### Compensation

Compensation represents **effort-based mechanisms** that preserve output
despite constrained recovery capacity.

Compensation explains why performance may remain acceptable
while sustainability degrades.

---

## Assessment Logic

SoftFocus assessments are:

- deterministic,
- reproducible,
- non-adaptive,
- free of recommendations.

Identical inputs always produce identical outputs.

The system describes states, not trajectories.
It does not predict outcomes or improvement.

---

## Interpretation Boundary

SoftFocus provides **orientation and structure**, not solutions.

The system explains:
- why degradation may be gradual,
- why no single failure point exists,
- why common advice may fail under certain constraints.

It does not instruct users what to do.

---

## Non-Clinical Scope

SoftFocus is strictly non-medical and non-clinical.

It does not:
- diagnose conditions,
- provide treatment,
- offer therapy or mental health guidance,
- replace clinical or psychological assessment.

All terminology is analytical and informational only.

---

## Summary

SoftFocus is a structured thinking tool.

It helps individuals and organizations
understand sustainability limits
before failure becomes visible or costly.
