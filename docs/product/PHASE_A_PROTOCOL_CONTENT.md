# SoftFocus — Phase A: Protocol Content Draft

Status: DRAFT  
Scope: Module Content  
Version: v1.0

---

## Purpose

This document defines the explanatory content
inside each protocol module.

Content explains structure and mechanisms.
It does not instruct or prescribe behavior.

---

## Module 1 — Cognitive Load Containment

### What this module addresses

This module focuses on how cognitive load
accumulates beyond visible tasks.

Load often persists through:
- background thinking
- unresolved decisions
- partial task engagement

### Why this matters

When cognitive load is uncontained,
the system remains in a state of readiness,
preventing effective recovery.

This state feels like:
- inability to disengage
- mental noise
- constant low-level pressure

---

## Module 2 — Recovery Reactivation

### What this module addresses

This module explains why rest
may stop producing relief.

Recovery is not only about duration.
It depends on:
- timing
- contrast
- separation from load

### Why this matters

If recovery is ineffective,
fatigue accumulates even with pauses.

This creates the impression
that “rest no longer works”.

---

## Module 3 — Functional Boundary Reset

### What this module addresses

This module focuses on boundary clarity
between effort and non-effort states.

Blurred boundaries cause:
- continuous partial engagement
- loss of recovery contrast
- prolonged activation

### Why this matters

Without clear boundaries,
the system cannot fully exit load mode,
even outside work contexts.

---

## Module 4 — Output Recalibration

### What this module addresses

This module explains mismatch
between effort and expected output.

When output expectations exceed capacity,
effort increases without proportional results.

### Why this matters

This mismatch accelerates exhaustion
and reinforces inefficiency loops.

## Draft Status

This content is explanatory only.
No instructions or exercises are included.

Further refinement may adjust wording,
but not structure or intent.
