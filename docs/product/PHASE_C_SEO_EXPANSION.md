# SoftFocus — Phase C: SEO Audience Expansion

Status: PLANNED  
Scope: Programmatic SEO  
Version: v1.0

---

## Purpose

This document defines expansion
from the initial SEO-100 audience set
to a broader SEO-300 scope.

---

## Expansion Principle

Expansion increases reach
without increasing conceptual complexity.

All pages reuse:
- identical structure
- identical terminology
- identical assessment entry point

---

## Audience Selection Criteria

New audiences are selected based on:

- sustained cognitive load contexts
- responsibility-heavy roles
- prolonged decision-making pressure

---

## Structural Constraints

Each audience page:

- uses the same template
- modifies only contextual framing
- links directly to assessment

No new advice is introduced.

---

## Rollout Strategy

Expansion occurs in batches of 25–50 audiences.

Indexing and performance are evaluated
before each subsequent batch.

---

## Status

SEO expansion logic is defined.
Implementation follows indexing stability.
