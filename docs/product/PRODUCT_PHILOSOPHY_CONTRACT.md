## Scope & Compliance Boundary

This document defines **product philosophy constraints**.
It does not introduce features, behavior, or user guidance.

All statements are non-clinical and non-therapeutic.

---

# SoftFocus — Product Philosophy Contract

## Core Position

SoftFocus operates at the **intersection of analytical technology
and interpretive clarity**.

The product is designed to feel simple,
despite operating on complex internal models.

Complexity must remain **hidden**, not removed.

---

## Principle 1 — Radical Simplicity

SoftFocus must present only **essential elements**.

Anything that:
- requires explanation,
- creates hesitation,
- introduces choice without necessity,

is considered a defect.

If an element must be explained, it does not belong on the surface.

---

## Principle 2 — Insanely Great (as a Constraint)

“Insanely great” in SoftFocus means:

- no visible system complexity,
- no configuration,
- no learning curve,
- no sense of effort to understand the tool.

The user must feel orientation, not instruction.

---

## Principle 3 — Experience Over Specification

SoftFocus does not communicate value
through features, metrics, or specifications.

The product experience must convey:

- clarity,
- calm,
- reduction of cognitive noise,
- a sense that “this explains something important”.

Technical sophistication must never be foregrounded.

---

## Principle 4 — Packages of Emphasis

Every SoftFocus product is a **package of emphasis**.

This means:
- deliberate inclusion of some signals,
- deliberate exclusion of others.

What is omitted is as important as what is shown.

Adding elements without removing others
violates this principle.

---

## Principle 5 — “It Just Works”

SoftFocus must be usable:

- without a manual,
- without onboarding,
- without tutorials,
- without progressive disclosure.

If guidance is required,
it belongs in interpretation documents,
not in the product surface.

---

## Principle 6 — Product as an Object of Taste

SoftFocus treats product design
as an expression of judgment and restraint.

A feature that is correct but inelegant
must not ship.

A feature that is powerful but noisy
must not ship.

---

## Enforcement Rule

If a product element:
- increases surface complexity,
- requires justification,
- or explains itself,

it violates this contract
and must be removed or redesigned.

---

## Summary

SoftFocus is not optimized for engagement,
retention, or delight.

It is optimized for **clarity without effort**.

The best SoftFocus experience feels
quiet, obvious, and inevitable.
