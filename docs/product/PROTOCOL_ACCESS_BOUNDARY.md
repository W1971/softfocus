# Protocol Access Boundary

## Status
- Type: entitlement-governance
- Scope: post-assessment depth
- Mutability: restricted

## Purpose

The Structured Recovery Protocol represents post-assessment depth,
not an entry point.

Its role is to provide conceptual structure after recovery capacity
constraints have been identified.

## Public vs Restricted boundary

### Public layer MAY include:
- protocol overview
- purpose and scope description
- non-clinical framing
- explanation of what the protocol is and is not

### Restricted layer (entitlement-only):
- full module texts
- framework explanations
- load and recovery models
- structured reference material

## Indexing rules

- Public overview pages may be indexed
- Full protocol modules MUST NOT be indexed
- Protocol content must not be duplicated in guides or blogs

## Relationship to products

The protocol:
- does not replace assessments
- does not automatically interpret results
- does not prescribe actions or interventions

It exists to support correct interpretation, not behavior change.

## Economic positioning

Protocol access is entitlement-based:
- one-time payment
- static content
- no expiration
- no ongoing support implied

This ensures low operational overhead, auditability,
and clear non-clinical boundaries.
