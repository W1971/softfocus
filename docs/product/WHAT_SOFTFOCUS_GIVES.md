# What SoftFocus Gives

## Purpose

This document explains what SoftFocus provides to users
in situations where there is no clear diagnosis,
no obvious point of failure,
and no simple way out.

Its role is explanatory.
It does not promise recovery, change, or resolution.

---

## The user’s starting condition

Users typically arrive at SoftFocus in a specific state:

- they remain functional
- they continue working and making decisions
- they are not in an acute crisis

At the same time:
- rest no longer restores capacity
- effort produces diminishing returns
- advice feels irrelevant or irritating
- internal self-analysis becomes constant

This state is often more exhausting
than workload itself.

---

## What SoftFocus provides instead of diagnosis

SoftFocus does not provide diagnoses.

Instead, it provides orientation.

Users receive:
- a classification of sustained load
- an understanding of recovery capacity limits
- visibility into compensation mechanisms

This allows users to understand their condition
without framing it as illness or personal failure.

---

## What SoftFocus provides instead of a failure point

Users often search for a moment where something “broke”.

SoftFocus replaces this search with a continuous axis:

burnout → recovery capacity → compensation

This axis explains why:
- degradation can be gradual
- performance may persist while capacity declines
- symptoms appear without a single triggering event

---

## What SoftFocus provides instead of a solution

SoftFocus does not offer a solution or a plan.

It provides boundaries.

Users learn:
- which actions are unlikely to work in their current state
- why additional effort may increase depletion
- why certain recovery attempts backfire

---

## What users actually receive

SoftFocus provides:

1. Language  
2. Structure  
3. Reduced self-blame  
4. Permission to pause

---

## Summary

SoftFocus does not help users “get better”.

It helps them stop misunderstanding what is happening
and stop applying actions that increase depletion.
