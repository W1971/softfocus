# SoftFocus — Phase B: Localization Framework

Status: ACTIVE  
Scope: Multilingual Consistency  
Version: v1.0

---

## Purpose

Phase B defines how SoftFocus is localized
without altering meaning, structure, or tone.

Localization is treated as a structural operation,
not a creative or cultural one.

---

## Supported Languages (Phase B)

- Russian (RU)
- English (EN)
- Spanish (ES)
- Arabic (AR)

English remains the reference language for routing.
Russian is the canonical language for product meaning.

---

## Core Localization Principle

Localization must preserve:

- identical structure
- identical information density
- identical logical flow
- identical tone

No adaptation.
No rewriting.
No interpretation.

---

## What Is Localized

- assessment questions
- result explanations
- protocol descriptions
- UX labels
- system messages

---

## What Is NOT Localized

- logic
- structure
- category definitions
- protocol principles

These are invariant.

---

## Terminology Lock

Canonical terms must be translated once
and reused consistently.

No synonyms.
No stylistic variation.

---

## Translation Quality Rules

Each translation must:

- remain neutral
- avoid emotional amplification
- avoid simplification
- avoid cultural metaphors

Literal accuracy is preferred over fluency.

---

## Validation Requirement

Each localized version must:

- pass content validation
- preserve section ordering
- preserve paragraph count where possible

---

## Rollout Order

1. Russian (baseline)
2. English
3. Spanish
4. Arabic

Each language is completed independently.

---

## Status

Localization framework is defined.
Implementation proceeds language by language.
