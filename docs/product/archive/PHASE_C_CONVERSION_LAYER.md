# SoftFocus — Phase C: Conversion Layer

Status: ACTIVE  
Scope: SEO to Assessment Flow  
Version: v1.0

---

## Purpose

Phase C defines how users move
from programmatic SEO pages
into the assessment.

The goal is clarity, not persuasion.

---

## Conversion Philosophy

Conversion is treated as:

- contextual relevance
- logical continuity
- informational progression

Not as optimization or funneling.

---

## Entry Point

Users enter via:

- audience-specific SEO pages

These pages do not stand alone.
They exist only to route users into assessment.

---

## SEO Page Role

SEO pages:

- describe context-specific manifestations of burnout
- reuse identical core concepts
- do not introduce new advice

They prepare the user for assessment.

---

## Canonical CTA

Each SEO page includes exactly one CTA:

**Take the burnout assessment**

No alternatives.
No urgency.

---

## Placement Rules

CTA appears:

- after mechanism explanation
- before any protocol mention

No sticky buttons.
No repeated prompts.

---

## Transition Logic

The SEO page answers:

- “Why this context matters”

The assessment answers:

- “What is my state”

The protocol answers:

- “What structure exists for persistent signals”

Each layer has one responsibility.

---

## Conversion Success Metrics

- assessment start rate
- assessment completion rate
- drop-off per question block

No A/B manipulation in Phase C.

---

## Status

Conversion layer logic is defined.
Implementation must respect Phase 1 and Phase A boundaries.
