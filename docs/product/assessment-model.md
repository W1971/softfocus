# SoftFocus Assessment Model

## Core Formula
Recovery Fit = Sleep × Cognitive Load

Sleep alone is not sufficient.
Load alone is not diagnostic.

## States
- Stable Recovery
- Compensated Load
- Recovery Debt
- Systemic Deficit

## Determinism
The assessment is deterministic.
Identical inputs always produce identical outputs.

## Scope
The model is non-medical and non-clinical.
It describes operational sustainability, not health.

## Non-Clinical Scope Declaration

This document describes an analytical assessment model.
It does not provide diagnosis, treatment, or therapeutic guidance,
and must not be interpreted as a mental health instrument.
