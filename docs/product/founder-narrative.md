# Founder Narrative

This assessment does not evaluate well-being.

It evaluates whether recovery closes
at the current cost of decisions.

## Founder Frame
The primary risk is not fatigue.
The primary risk is degradation of decision quality
and instability of execution.

## Interpretation Rule
Recovery is sufficient only if it closes
without increasing operational risk.

This framing applies to founders, executives,
and roles with high cost-of-error decisions.
