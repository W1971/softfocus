# Test Responses → SoftFocus Value Mapping

This document maps common user responses from assessments
to the value delivered by SoftFocus.

It is an internal reference.
It is not user-facing.

| User response | Missing capability | SoftFocus provides | Reference section |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| “I don’t understand what’s happening to me” | Orientation | System-level framing | WHAT_SOFTFOCUS_GIVES / Orientation |
| “I’m still functioning but feel worse” | Axis | Burnout → Recovery → Compensation | Failure point |
| “Rest doesn’t help” | Recovery model | Rest vs recovery capacity | Boundaries |
| “Advice irritates me” | Load reduction | No instructions | No solution |
| “I feel guilty for not pushing through” | De-personalization | Structural limits | Reduced self-blame |
| “I don’t know what to do next” | Permission | Stability without regression | Permission to pause |

This mapping explains why user resonance is high
without relying on motivation or advice.
