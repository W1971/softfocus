# Misalignment Types (v6 Concept)

This document defines internal analytical types.
They are not exposed to the user.

## Purpose
Misalignment types explain *why* recovery fails,
not *what to do* about it.

They increase interpretive depth without adding recommendations.

## Types

### Load-driven deficit
Recovery fails due to excessive cognitive load
despite adequate sleep duration.

The limiting factor is decision density and cost of error,
not time spent resting.

---

### Sleep-driven deficit
Recovery fails due to insufficient or unstable sleep
despite moderate cognitive load.

The limiting factor is recovery capacity,
not workload intensity.

---

### Volatility-driven deficit
Cumulative deficit forms due to instability
in sleep or workload patterns.

Average values may appear acceptable,
while variance drives degradation.

---

### Decision-density overload
The primary factor is concentration of
high cost-of-error decisions.

Total work time may be moderate,
but cognitive risk accumulates rapidly.

## Constraints
- Not user-facing
- No UI exposure
- No recommendations
- No scoring changes in v5
- Concept locked until explicit version upgrade
