# SoftFocus — Product Manifesto

## What we do

SoftFocus identifies misalignment between recovery and cognitive load.
The product provides structured orientation, not prescriptions.

## What we do NOT do

- No medical diagnosis
- No recommendations
- No motivation or coaching
- No action plans
- No behavioral tracking

## Core principle

Understanding precedes action.
Clarity precedes motivation.

SoftFocus is a thinking tool, not a wellness activity.

## Boundary Notice

SoftFocus products are non-clinical analytical tools.
They do not diagnose, treat, or replace mental health services
and operate strictly outside of therapeutic contexts.
