# Return Signal

Return Signal defines the condition under which reassessment becomes informative.

It is not a call to action.
It is not a recommendation.
It does not imply improvement.

## Canonical form
Reassessment becomes informative after sustained changes
in sleep regime and/or cognitive load over several weeks.

## Constraints
- No urgency language
- No dates or countdowns
- No promises of improvement

## Purpose
Repeated assessments without changed conditions
do not improve clarity and may distort interpretation.
