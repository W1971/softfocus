# SoftFocus v2 — Conceptual Axis Model

Status: DESIGN_ONLY  
Implementation: FORBIDDEN  
Scope: Analytical framing only

---

## 1. Why v2 Exists

v1 explains *depletion over time*.

v2 exists for users who report:
- preserved functionality
- no collapse
- no clear burnout
- persistent internal friction

v2 does not replace v1.
It offers a **parallel explanatory lens**.

---

## 2. Nature of a v2 Axis

A v2 axis must:
- explain experience, not behavior
- describe structure, not failure
- avoid improvement narratives
- remain non-clinical

A v2 axis answers:
> “Why does this feel unsustainable even though nothing is broken?”

---

## 3. Canonical Candidate (Conceptual)

### Cognitive Load Variability (CLV)

Focus:
- instability of cognitive demand
- variance over time
- unpredictability of effort cost

Key insight:
> It is not the amount of load, but its fluctuation, that erodes clarity.

---

## 4. What the Axis Describes

The axis describes:
- volatility
- fragmentation
- uneven effort distribution
- loss of internal rhythm

It does NOT describe:
- motivation
- discipline
- habits
- resilience

---

## 5. Relationship to v1

| v1 | v2 |
|----|----|
| depletion | instability |
| recovery capacity | predictability |
| compensation | internal noise |

The axes must never merge.

---

## 6. What v2 Will Never Do

- No recommendations
- No prescriptions
- No training
- No optimization
- No productivity framing

v2 exists to **name a structure**, not to change it.

---

## 7. Lock Statement

This document:
- does not authorize development
- does not imply timeline
- does not allow UI or backend work

Opening implementation requires:
- explicit governance approval
- V2_APPROVAL_GATE = PASS
- version boundary v2.0
