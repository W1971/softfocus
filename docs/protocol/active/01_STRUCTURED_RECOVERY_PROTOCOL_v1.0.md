# Structured Recovery Protocol

## What this protocol is

This protocol is a structured intervention designed to support recovery
after sustained burnout-related load.

It is based on patterns observed in burnout assessments
and focuses on clarifying conditions that affect recovery capacity.

The protocol does not attempt to motivate, diagnose, or treat.
Its role is to provide structure where intuitive self-guidance is unreliable.

This protocol is intended to be accessed
after completing a SoftFocus burnout assessment.

Its structure assumes reduced signal clarity
and compensates for impaired self-calibration
under sustained cognitive load.

---

## What this protocol is not

This protocol is not:
- therapy
- coaching
- a productivity system
- a motivational program
- a personalized treatment plan

It does not replace professional care.
It does not promise outcomes.
It does not provide step-by-step instructions.

## How to use this protocol

This protocol is intended to be read slowly and selectively.

You are not expected to apply everything.
You are not expected to act immediately.

The value of the protocol lies in:
- reframing how load and recovery are understood
- identifying constraints that are often overlooked
- reducing unproductive self-pressure during recovery attempts

Sections are independent.
You may return to them as your context changes.

---

## When this protocol is insufficient

This protocol is not sufficient if:
- symptoms continue to escalate despite reduced load
- cognitive or emotional functioning continues to deteriorate
- recovery capacity remains absent over extended periods

In such cases, structured external support may be required.

This protocol does not provide guidance
on selecting or engaging such support.
