# Professional Burnout Stabilization Protocol

## Purpose

This protocol extends the Structured Recovery Protocol
for individuals operating under sustained professional load.

It is designed for contexts where:
- responsibility cannot be paused
- decision density remains high
- recovery must occur without full disengagement

The protocol prioritizes containment and risk reduction
over optimization or performance recovery.

---

## Relationship to the Core Protocol

This protocol assumes familiarity with:
- burnout result interpretation
- load categorization
- recovery capacity constraints

It does not repeat foundational explanations.
It applies them to professional operating environments.

---

## Module 1 — Professional Load Topology

Professional burnout is shaped by load that is:
- persistent
- externally coupled
- non-negotiable

This module maps:
- responsibility-driven load
- escalation pathways
- invisible decision accumulation

The goal is recognition, not reduction.

---

## Module 2 — Cognitive Risk Containment

In professional contexts, burnout risk increases
before performance visibly declines.

This module focuses on:
- early cognitive risk markers
- false resilience signals
- delayed cost patterns

Containment precedes recovery.

---

## Module 3 — Boundary Architecture Under Obligation

Professional boundaries differ from personal boundaries.

This module addresses:
- boundaries that cannot be enforced directly
- load deflection without conflict
- structural protection of recovery windows

The protocol does not recommend withdrawal.

---

## Module 4 — Decision Load Governance

Decision load is the primary burnout driver
in senior and high-responsibility roles.

This module provides:
- decision deferral principles
- resolution thresholds
- criteria for non-decision

Reducing decisions restores capacity indirectly.

---

## Module 5 — Sustained Operation Without Depletion

This module does not define sustainable performance.
It defines **unsustainable patterns**.

Avoidance, not achievement, is the stabilization mechanism.

---

## When This Protocol Is Insufficient

This protocol is insufficient if:
- containment fails to slow depletion
- professional demands escalate faster than capacity stabilizes

In such cases, external structural intervention may be required.

This protocol does not specify how to obtain it.
