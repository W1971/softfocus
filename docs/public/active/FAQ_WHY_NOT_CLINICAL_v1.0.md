# Why SoftFocus Is Not a Clinical Assessment

Purpose: Boundary clarity & trust

## Short Answer

Because SoftFocus is designed to help people understand
**performance sustainability risk**, not to diagnose health conditions.

Clinical assessments and SoftFocus serve different purposes.

---

## What Clinical Assessments Do

Clinical or psychological assessments are designed to:
- diagnose mental health conditions,
- support treatment decisions,
- follow medical or therapeutic standards.

They are essential when someone is experiencing
health-related distress or impairment.

---

## What SoftFocus Does Instead

SoftFocus looks at:
- how cognitive work is sustained over time,
- how decision quality is maintained under load,
- whether recovery is working or failing,
- where performance degradation is likely to appear first.

This is closer to **risk awareness** than diagnosis.

---

## Why This Boundary Matters

Many professionals function well while gradually degrading.
Clinical tools often activate **after** performance has already dropped.

SoftFocus exists earlier:
- when people are still performing,
- when problems are structural,
- when intervention is about awareness, not treatment.

---

## Does “Not Clinical” Mean “Not Serious”?

No.

It means:
- no labels,
- no diagnoses,
- no medical claims,
- no therapy language.

It allows the assessment to be:
- safe to share,
- non-stigmatizing,
- useful at work.

---

## When Clinical Help Is Appropriate

If someone experiences:
- persistent distress,
- inability to function,
- health or safety concerns,

professional medical or psychological support is important.

SoftFocus does not replace that.

---

## In One Sentence

SoftFocus helps you understand **how sustainable your current performance is** —
not whether something is “wrong” with you.
