Burnout is often discussed as a feeling.
SoftFocus looks at it as a **sustainability problem**.

The assessment is designed for professionals
whose work depends on sustained thinking,
decision-making, and responsibility over time.

Instead of asking how you feel,
SoftFocus looks at patterns such as:
- how decisions are made under fatigue,
- how stable attention is across the day,
- whether recovery actually restores capacity,
- how performance is being maintained.

This approach is informed by established work in
occupational burnout research, human factors engineering,
systems reliability thinking, and longitudinal assessment practices.

These fields are commonly used in industries
where performance degradation appears gradually
and errors emerge late — such as engineering,
healthcare, aviation, and operations.

SoftFocus is not a clinical or medical assessment.
It does not diagnose conditions or provide treatment.
This is intentional.

By staying non-clinical, the assessment remains:
- non-stigmatizing,
- safe to share,
- useful at work,
- focused on awareness rather than labels.

After completing the assessment,
you receive a clear classification of your current burnout stage,
your primary risk area,
and an explanation of what this pattern means.

The goal is clarity.

SoftFocus helps answer a simple question:
**How sustainable is my current way of working?**
