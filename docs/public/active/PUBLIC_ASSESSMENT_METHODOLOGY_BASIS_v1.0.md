## A Clear Boundary First

SoftFocus is not a medical or psychological diagnosis.

It is a structured assessment of **burnout risk patterns**
related to sustained cognitive work.

---

## What Informs the Assessment

The SoftFocus assessment is informed by
established professional research in four areas:

---

## Occupational Burnout Research

We use well-established insights showing that burnout:
- develops gradually,
- is driven by effort–recovery imbalance,
- is often masked by compensation.

We do not use clinical diagnostic criteria.

---

## Human Factors & Cognitive Load Research

Our questions reflect how:
- decision quality degrades under fatigue,
- attention fragments over time,
- errors become more likely under sustained load.

This approach is widely used in safety-critical industries.

---

## Systems & Reliability Thinking

We treat burnout risk like any other performance risk:
- by looking for early signals,
- by focusing on patterns,
- by avoiding emotional labels.

---

## Longitudinal Assessment Principles

The assessment is designed to be meaningful over time.
Repeated assessments reveal trends,
not “scores” or “improvement badges”.

---

## Why This Is Not a Hobby Test

- fixed methodology
- consistent questions
- reproducible results
- professional language
- clear boundaries

---

## Free vs Paid Results

The free assessment provides orientation.

The paid report provides deeper analysis:
- interactions between risk factors,
- time-based scenarios,
- interpretation of consequences.

---

## Final Thought

SoftFocus exists to provide clarity
for people whose work depends on sustained thinking.
