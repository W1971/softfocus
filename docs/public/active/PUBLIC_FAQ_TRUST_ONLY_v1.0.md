## 1. What is SoftFocus?

SoftFocus is an assessment that helps professionals understand
burnout **risk patterns** related to sustained cognitive work.

It focuses on performance sustainability, not emotions or diagnoses.

---

## 2. Is this a medical or psychological test?

No.  
SoftFocus is not a clinical assessment and does not diagnose
mental health conditions.

It is designed for awareness and orientation.

---

## 3. What does the assessment measure?

It looks at patterns such as:
- decision load under fatigue,
- attention stability,
- recovery effectiveness,
- compensation used to maintain performance.

---

## 4. Why doesn’t it ask how I feel?

Feelings fluctuate and are difficult to compare over time.

SoftFocus focuses on observable patterns that remain meaningful
across different situations and roles.

---

You receive:
- your current burnout stage,
- your primary risk area,
- an explanation of what this pattern means,
- guidance on when reassessment is useful.

---

## 6. Is the assessment anonymous?

Yes.  
SoftFocus is designed to be anonymous by default
and does not sell personal data.

---

## 7. How accurate is this assessment?

The assessment is structured, deterministic,
and based on established professional research domains.

It is not intended to be exact or predictive,
but to provide clarity about risk patterns.

---

## 8. How often should I retake it?

Reassessment is meaningful when:
- workload changes,
- responsibility increases,
- recovery stops working.

There is no benefit in frequent retesting.

---

Yes.  
Results are written to be non-stigmatizing and safe to share
with colleagues or managers.

---

## 10. Who should not use SoftFocus?

or health-related concerns,
professional medical or psychological support is appropriate.

SoftFocus does not replace that.

SoftFocus is about sustainability,
not pushing performance further.

“How sustainable is my current way of working?”
