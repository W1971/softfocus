# SoftFocus v2.0 — Release Notes

SoftFocus v2.0 introduces a structured way to assess
whether recovery closes under current cognitive load.

This release shifts the focus from sleep quality alone
to recovery–load alignment.

## What’s new
- Assessment of recovery in the context of cognitive load
- Deterministic results with stable interpretation
- Clear separation between state, risk, and return signal

## What this is not
- Not a medical assessment
- Not a productivity optimizer
- Not a recommendation engine

## Who this is for
- Knowledge workers under sustained cognitive load
- Founders and decision-makers
- Professionals seeking clarity, not advice

## Core idea
Sleep is not inherently good or bad.
It is sufficient or insufficient relative to load.

## Availability
The assessment is available without registration.
Results are fully accessible without payment.
