# Review — Path from $10k to $25k Monthly Revenue
*(No change to monetization model)*

## Baseline Model (Frozen)

- One-time purchases only
- Analytical reports
- Price range: $29–39
- No subscriptions
- No retention mechanics

This model does not change.

---

## $10k / Month — Natural Extension

- ~$29 × ~350 purchases
- ~12 purchases per day
- Achieved through:
  - existing assessments
  - organic traffic
  - validated shadow demand

No increase in pressure or persuasion.

---

## $25k / Month — Parallelization, Not Optimization

Revenue scales by **multiplying products**, not users.

### Parallel Products

1. **Recovery Deep Report** (core)
2. **Role-Specific Reports**
   - Founder
   - Developer
   - Manager
3. **Longitudinal Comparison Report**
   - follow-up after 30–60 days
   - separate purchase (not a subscription)

---

## Example Distribution

| Product | Monthly Revenue |
|------|-----------------|
| Core Recovery Report | $10k |
| Role-Specific Reports | $8k |
| Comparison Report | $7k |
| **Total** | **$25k** |

---

## Why This Is Low Risk

- No recurring billing
- No promises of outcomes
- No behavioral pressure
- Explicit governance and rollback

---

## Review Note

This path is a **capacity review**, not a forecast.
Execution remains gated by governance decisions.
