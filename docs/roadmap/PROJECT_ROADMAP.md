# SoftFocus — Project Roadmap

Version: v1.1  
Status: ACTIVE  
Audience: Maintainers, auditors, stakeholders

---

## Core Principle

SoftFocus progresses by:

1. locking meaning first,
2. enforcing governance,
3. expanding access,
4. enabling conversion.

Scale is allowed only after stability is proven.

---

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1 — Assessment Logic
Status: LOCKED

Completed:
- assessment intent defined;
- question structure fixed;
- scoring and classification logic frozen;
- result categories locked.

No further changes allowed.

---

### Phase A — Governance & Protocol
Status: LOCKED

Completed:
- governance rules formalized;
- audit and test logging enforced;
- READY classification defined;
- release authorization formalized;
- CI governance gates installed.

No bypass mechanisms allowed.

---

### Phase B — Localization
Status: LOCKED

Completed:
- RU localization of governance documents;
- RU localization of architecture documents;
- RU user-facing documentation created;
- EN↔RU terminology fixed;
- structure parity enforced by CI;
- user-content guard enforced;
- Phase B formally closed and locked.

Localization scope is closed.

---

## Current State

All foundational phases (1, A, B) are complete and locked.

The system is:
- structurally stable;
- governance-enforced;
- auditable;
- ready for controlled expansion.

---

## Next Phase

### Phase C — Conversion Layer
Status: NOT STARTED

Planned scope:
- definition of paid boundaries;
- neutral presentation of access limitations;
- transparent conditions;
- separation of free and paid areas.

Hard constraints:
- no urgency language;
- no manipulation or pressure;
- no changes to assessment logic;
- no changes to result interpretation.

Phase C may only begin
after explicit kickoff documentation.

---

## Future Phases

### Phase D — Release & Distribution
Status: PLANNED

Expected scope:
- tag-based releases only;
- controlled indexing;
- sitemap and distribution management;
- release-level audit artifacts.

---

## Governance Rule

A phase may start only if:
- the previous phase is locked;
- all required documentation exists;
- governance checks are enforced in CI.

Violations block progression.

---

## Final Statement

This roadmap defines the **authorized progression**
of the SoftFocus project.

Any deviation requires
explicit governance approval
and a new document version.
