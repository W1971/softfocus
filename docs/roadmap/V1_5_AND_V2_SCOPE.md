# SoftFocus Version Roadmap
## v1.5.0 (Minor) and v2.0.0 (Major)

Status: Design-only  
Execution: Explicitly excluded

---

## v1.5.0 — Minor Version Scope

### Purpose

The purpose of v1.5.0 is to extend distribution
without modifying the product core.

This version increases surface coverage
while preserving product logic, governance,
and entitlement architecture.

---

### Allowed Scope

#### Languages

- ES: extend to parity with EN (5–7 role pages)
- AR: extend to 5 role pages
- No additional languages are permitted

#### Content

- Role pages only
- Strictly based on the existing role-page template
- New pages are allowed only if:
  - impressions are observed in GSC
  - no governance warnings are present

#### Documentation

- Release notes for v1.5.0
- Version bump in overview.md

---

### Explicitly Forbidden in v1.5.0

- New calculators
- Modifications to assessments
- Changes to entitlement logic
- UI extensions
- Protocol changes

Minor versions extend surface only.
They do not add depth.

---

### Exit Criteria

v1.5.0 is considered complete when:

- Distribution surface is wider
- Product logic remains unchanged
- Revenue flow is identical to v1.4.x
- Governance remains boring and stable

---

## v2.0.0 — Major Version Direction

### Definition

v2.0.0 introduces a new analytical axis.
It is not an upgrade or extension of the burnout axis.

Existing axes remain unchanged and supported.

---

### Candidate Analytical Axes

#### A. Decision Saturation

Strengths:
- Strong B2B relevance
- Clear analytical framing
- High formalization potential

Risk:
- Tendency to drift into prescriptive advice

---

#### B. Cognitive Load Variability

Strengths:
- Highly measurable
- Non-clinical by nature
- Strong analytical depth

Risk:
- Requires careful explanation for SEO clarity

---

#### C. Temporal Compression / Time Fragmentation

Strengths:
- Relevant to remote and executive contexts
- Intuitive experiential framing

Risk:
- Overlap with productivity narratives

---

#### D. Chronic Context Switching

Strengths:
- Closely aligned with SoftFocus core DNA
- Strong analytical continuity

Risk:
- Terminological overload if not tightly scoped

---

### Global Risks for v2.0.0

- Axis mixing
- Calculator duplication
- Protocol inflation
- Loss of system linearity

---

### Mandatory Constraint

Only one new analytical axis is permitted.

Each new axis requires:
- its own calculators
- its own interpretation layer
- its own protocol
- its own entitlement

The existing burnout axis must remain unchanged.
