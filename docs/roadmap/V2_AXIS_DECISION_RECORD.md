# v2 Analytical Axis — Decision Record

## Status

**DESIGN ONLY.**

No axis is approved.
No implementation is authorized.

---

## Purpose

This document defines the decision framework
for selecting exactly one analytical axis for v2.

It does not propose solutions.
It does not define scope.
It does not allow execution.

---

## Constraints (Hard)

An axis MAY be approved only if it:

- is strictly non-clinical
- explains states not covered by burnout
- is expressible without advice
- supports deterministic assessment
- does not require behavior change
- does not overlap with v1 axis

---

## Explicit Exclusions

The following are NOT acceptable axes:

- motivation
- resilience
- productivity
- discipline
- wellbeing programs
- lifestyle change
- emotional intelligence

---

## Candidate Axes (Exploratory Only)

- Decision Saturation
- Cognitive Load Variability
- Temporal Compression
- Chronic Context Switching

These are candidates, not commitments.

---

## Approval Rules

- exactly one axis may be approved
- approval requires explicit governance sign-off
- approval creates a new protocol and entitlement
- rejection creates no obligation to replace

---

## Relationship to Phase A

Axis selection MUST NOT begin
until Phase A is explicitly closed.
