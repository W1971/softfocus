# SoftFocus v2 — Analytical Axis Planning (Design Only)

## Status
DESIGN ONLY  
No implementation  
No commitment  
No timeline

---

## Context

SoftFocus v1 is complete and frozen.

- Core axis (burnout → recovery capacity → compensation) is stable
- Governance and CI enforcement are active
- Mobile v1 is complete
- v1.x expansion is limited to distribution only

Version v2 is not an upgrade of burnout.
It introduces a new analytical axis that exists in parallel.

---

## Core Principle

Version v2 is allowed only if:

- exactly one new analytical axis is introduced
- the axis does not duplicate or extend burnout
- the axis does not prescribe actions or advice
- the axis has:
  - its own terminology
  - its own assessment
  - its own calculator (if applicable)
  - its own protocol
  - its own entitlement

One version = one axis.

---

## Why v2 Exists

User responses frequently indicate:

- no clear diagnosis
- no obvious failure point
- preserved functionality
- persistent strain or friction
- inability to explain what exactly is wrong

The burnout axis explains part of this,
but not all observed patterns.

v2 exists to provide an alternative explanatory lens,
not more content.

## Candidate Axes (Non-Exhaustive)

The following axes are under consideration.
None are approved.

### A. Decision Saturation

Focus:
Cumulative burden of unresolved decisions.

Strengths:
- Intuitive for B2B and leadership roles
- Structurally measurable

Risks:
- High risk of advice drift
- Close proximity to productivity narratives

---

### B. Cognitive Load Variability

Focus:
Instability and fluctuation of cognitive load over time.

Strengths:
- Strong alignment with observed assessment responses
- Non-clinical by nature
- Explains why rest may not restore capacity

Risks:
- Higher explanatory complexity
- Requires careful interpretation design

---

### C. Temporal Compression / Time Fragmentation

Focus:
Loss of coherent time blocks despite available hours.

Strengths:
- Strong subjective resonance
- Relevant for remote and executive contexts

Risks:
- Overlap with productivity framing
- Risk of superficial interpretation

---

### D. Chronic Context Switching

Focus:
Sustained cost of frequent context transitions.

Strengths:
- Close to SoftFocus core DNA
- Explains fatigue without overload

Risks:
- Terminological density
- Potential overlap with load variability

---

## Shared Risks (v2)

- axis mixing
- calculator duplication
- protocol inflation
- loss of product linearity
- drift into psychological advice

---

## Constraints

- No hybrid axes
- No incremental extensions of burnout
- No multi-axis releases
- No UI-led justification

---

## Next Step (Optional)

A separate decision document may be created
to select or reject a single axis.

No decision is required at this stage.
