# SoftFocus — Roadmap (Phase B Kickoff)

Version: v1.0  
Status: ACTIVE  
Previous Core: Phase 1 / Phase A (LOCKED)

---

## Purpose

This roadmap defines the platform state
after locking the core (Phase 1 / Phase A)
and initiating Phase B (Localization).

Phase B does not modify logic.
It expands reach with strict structural parity.

---

## Locked Foundation

### Phase 1 — Assessment (LOCKED)
- Assessment intent
- Question structure
- Result logic
- Interpretation categories

No changes allowed.

---

### Phase A — Structured Protocol (LOCKED)
- Protocol principles
- Module boundaries
- UX flow logic
- Paid boundary framing

No changes allowed.

## Phase B — Localization (ACTIVE)

### Goal
Provide multilingual access without reinterpretation.

### Scope
- Russian (RU)
- Spanish (ES)
- Arabic (AR)

### Constraints
- Identical structure across languages
- Canonical terminology preserved
- No cultural adaptation
- No additional advice or framing

### Deliverables
- Localized assessment copy
- Localized explanation text
- Identical routing logic
- Language-specific sitemaps

Status: IN PROGRESS

## Phase C — Conversion Layer (PLANNED)

Purpose:
Enable monetization aligned with trust and clarity.

Constraints:
- No urgency language
- No upsells
- No behavioral pressure

Status: PLANNED

---

## Phase D — Release & Distribution (PLANNED)

- Tag-based releases only
- Release-specific sitemap
- Controlled indexation
- App distribution (later)

Status: PLANNED

---

## Summary

The SoftFocus roadmap progresses by:
locking logic first,
then expanding access,
then enabling distribution.

Stability precedes scale.
