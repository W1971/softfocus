# SoftFocus — SEO Entry Index

This document defines primary organic entry points
and their intent alignment.

The index is designed for:
- low-frequency, high-intent discovery
- analytical, non-clinical interpretation
- calm entry into assessment logic

---

## Core Assessment (Primary Entry)

### /kalkulyator-sna
- Intent: High
- Purpose: Evaluate recovery–load alignment
- Role: Canonical analytical entry point

All guides ultimately link here.

---

## Conceptual Guides (Explanatory Layer)

### /son-ne-raven-vosstanovleniyu
- Intent: Explanatory
- Purpose: Reframe sleep vs recovery
- Role: Correct a common false assumption

### /kogda-son-ne-pomogaet
- Intent: Problem-aware
- Purpose: Explain recovery failure despite sleep
- Role: Pre-assessment clarification

---

## Systemic Guides (Structural Understanding)

### /guides/kompensaciya-vmesto-vosstanovleniya
- Intent: Analytical
- Purpose: Explain compensation as a risk pattern
- Role: Contextual depth, not action

### /guides/vosstanovlenie-ne-ravno-otdyhu
- Intent: Analytical
- Purpose: Separate rest from recovery capacity
- Role: Cognitive model reinforcement

---

## Linking Principles

- Guides link into assessment
- Assessment links back to relevant guides
- No circular CTAs
- No urgency language
- No behavioral prompts

---

## Indexing Notes

- Low-frequency, high-intent queries only
- Analytical tone preferred
- Avoid medical terminology
- Avoid optimization framing

---

## Planning Horizon

### 1 Week
- Verify internal links consistency
- Ensure canonical paths are stable
- No new pages

### 1 Month
- Observe organic entry behavior
- Adjust internal linking only if confusion appears
- No SEO expansion

### 6 Months
- Decide whether to add 1 new guide or keep index frozen
- Re-evaluate based on real usage, not traffic targets


---

## Canonical Interpretation Anchor

All explanatory SEO entries resolve into a single
canonical interpretation layer:

→ docs/guides/CANONICAL_EXPLANATIONS_INDEX_RU.md

Rules:
- SEO pages introduce concepts
- Canonical explanations define meaning
- No guide may redefine terminology outside the canonical index

This separation prevents semantic drift
between discovery and interpretation.
