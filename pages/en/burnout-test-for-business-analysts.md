# Burnout test for business analysts

## Role load context

In business analysis roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained analytical interpretation
across ambiguous and evolving requirements.

Common load patterns include:
- prolonged analysis under incomplete or shifting data
- responsibility for interpretation without decision authority
- repeated translation between technical and business contexts
- accumulation of unresolved analytical questions

These loads may persist
even when analysis output remains accurate.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that clarity or documentation
restores recovery capacity.

Under sustained interpretive load,
recovery competes with continuous cognitive reconciliation,
making documentation improvements insufficient.

Understanding capacity constraints
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained analytical interpretation
- emotional detachment as a protective response
- persistence of load across analysis cycles

It does not evaluate analytical skill,
domain expertise, or solution quality.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
