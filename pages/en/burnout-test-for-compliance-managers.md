# Burnout test for compliance managers

## Role load context

In compliance management roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained responsibility for rule adherence
under conditions of asymmetric accountability.

Common load patterns include:
- continuous interpretation of evolving regulations
- responsibility for compliance without full operational control
- exposure to potential penalties and reputational risk
- prolonged vigilance across audit and reporting cycles

These loads may accumulate
even when no violations are detected.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that clearer rules
reduce recovery strain.

Under sustained compliance pressure,
recovery competes with continuous interpretive vigilance,
making procedural clarity insufficient.

Understanding capacity constraints
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained compliance load
- emotional detachment as a containment response
- persistence of regulatory strain across cycles

It does not evaluate legal interpretation,
policy design, or enforcement effectiveness.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
