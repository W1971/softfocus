# Burnout test for consultants

## Role load context

In consulting roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained performance pressure across client contexts
rather than task complexity alone.

Common load patterns include:
- repeated immersion into unfamiliar domains
- responsibility for recommendations without implementation control
- frequent travel or context switching
- continuous expectation of high cognitive availability

These loads may accumulate
even when engagement durations are limited.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that adaptability or experience
restores recovery capacity.

Under sustained client-facing pressure,
recovery competes with continuous cognitive recalibration,
making surface coping strategies ineffective.

Understanding load structure
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained consulting pressure
- emotional detachment as a compensatory response
- persistence of load across engagement cycles

It does not evaluate expertise,
delivery quality, or client outcomes.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
