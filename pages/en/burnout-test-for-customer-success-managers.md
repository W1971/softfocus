# Burnout test for customer success managers

## Role load context

In customer success management roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained relational responsibility
under conditions of asymmetric accountability.

Common load patterns include:
- continuous monitoring of customer health signals
- responsibility for outcomes without full control over drivers
- emotional regulation across escalations and expectations
- long exposure to unresolved customer trajectories

These loads may persist
even when customer satisfaction scores appear stable.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that empathy or process clarity
restores recovery capacity.

Under sustained relational pressure,
recovery competes with ongoing emotional regulation,
making interpersonal skill improvement insufficient.

Understanding capacity constraints
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained relational load
- emotional detachment as a containment response
- persistence of load across customer lifecycles

It does not evaluate communication skills,
customer outcomes, or retention performance.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
