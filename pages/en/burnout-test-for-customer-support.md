# Burnout test for customer support professionals

## Role load context

In customer support roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained emotional and interaction load.

Common load patterns include:
- continuous exposure to user frustration or conflict
- high interaction volume with limited recovery intervals
- responsibility for resolution without control over root causes
- repetitive context switching across issues

These patterns may accumulate
even when service metrics remain acceptable.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that empathy or resilience
is sufficient to sustain recovery.

Under sustained interaction load,
recovery competes with emotional regulation demands,
making surface coping strategies ineffective.

Understanding load dynamics
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained interaction load
- emotional detachment as a containment response
- persistence of load across service cycles

It does not evaluate service quality
or personal suitability for support work.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
