# Burnout test for designers

## Role load context

In design roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained evaluative and iterative load.

Common load patterns include:
- continuous feedback cycles without closure
- ambiguity between subjective and objective criteria
- emotional exposure through evaluation of work
- parallel demands across multiple design stages

These patterns may accumulate
even when output quality remains high.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that creativity
benefits from rest or inspiration alone.

Under sustained evaluative load,
recovery competes with ongoing cognitive and emotional engagement,
making surface adjustments ineffective.

Understanding load dynamics
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained evaluative load
- emotional detachment as a protective response
- persistence of load across iteration cycles

It does not evaluate creativity
or aesthetic quality.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
