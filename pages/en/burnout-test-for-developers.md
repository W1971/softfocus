# Burnout test for developers

## Role load context

In development roles, burnout risk is often associated with sustained
cognitive load rather than visible overwork.

Common load patterns include:
- prolonged problem-solving without resolution
- frequent context switching across tasks and systems
- continuous attention fragmentation
- unresolved complexity carried across work cycles

These patterns can accumulate even when tasks feel familiar
or execution appears efficient.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Most burnout advice assumes available recovery capacity.

When burnout is present, execution bandwidth is reduced and
additional effort increases cognitive and decision load.

Understanding load dynamics precedes any attempt at change.
This assessment exists to support that understanding.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained load
- emotional detachment as a protective response
- load persistence over time

It does not evaluate motivation, discipline, or personal resilience.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
