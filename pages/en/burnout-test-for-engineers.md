# Burnout test for engineers

## Role load context

In engineering roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained cognitive precision demands
rather than visible overwork.

Common load patterns include:
- prolonged problem-solving without closure
- responsibility for correctness under constraints
- accumulation of unresolved technical complexity
- extended focus periods with limited recovery signals

These patterns may persist
even when systems remain stable.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that rest periods
restore cognitive recovery.

Under sustained precision demands,
recovery remains constrained by ongoing engagement,
making effort-based adjustment ineffective.

Understanding load structure
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained precision load
- emotional detachment as a protective response
- persistence of load across work cycles

It does not evaluate skill level
or technical proficiency.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
