# Burnout test for entrepreneurs

## Role load context

In entrepreneurial roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained uncertainty and responsibility accumulation
rather than workload volume.

Common load patterns include:
- prolonged decision making under incomplete information
- responsibility for outcomes without stable boundaries
- resource constraints across time, people, and capital
- absence of clear recovery or resolution cycles

These loads persist even when activity feels self-directed.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that autonomy or passion
restores recovery capacity.

Under sustained uncertainty,
recovery competes with continuous strategic vigilance,
making effort-based or motivational correction ineffective.

Understanding capacity constraints
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained uncertainty
- emotional detachment as a compensatory response
- persistence of load across entrepreneurial cycles

It does not evaluate vision,
talent, or business success.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
