# Burnout test for executives

## Role load context

In executive roles, burnout risk is often associated with sustained
strategic and decision load under conditions of limited recovery time.

Common load patterns include:
- high-stakes decisions with asymmetric consequences
- long-term responsibility without resolution cycles
- persistent cognitive availability expectations
- chronic time compression across domains

These loads accumulate even when operational tasks are delegated.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that rest and delegation restore capacity.

Under burnout conditions, decision load continues to consume
recovery resources even during reduced activity.

Understanding capacity constraints is required before change is possible.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained strategic load
- emotional detachment as a containment response
- long-term persistence of cognitive strain

It does not assess leadership quality or performance.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
