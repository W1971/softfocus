# Burnout test for finance analysts

## Role load context

In finance analyst roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained analytical vigilance
under uncertainty and time pressure.

Common load patterns include:
- prolonged concentration on complex financial models
- responsibility for interpretation under incomplete data
- compressed reporting cycles with limited recovery windows
- accumulation of accountability across forecasting periods

These loads may persist
even when analytical output remains accurate.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that discipline or optimization
restores recovery capacity.

Under sustained analytical vigilance,
recovery competes with continuous cognitive monitoring,
making efficiency improvements insufficient.

Understanding capacity constraints
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained analytical load
- emotional detachment as a protective response
- persistence of load across reporting cycles

It does not evaluate intelligence,
technical skill, or forecast accuracy.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
