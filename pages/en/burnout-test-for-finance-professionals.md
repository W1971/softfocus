# Burnout test for finance professionals

## Role load context

In finance roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained high-stakes decision load under time pressure.

Common load patterns include:
- responsibility for risk-sensitive outcomes
- prolonged attention to detail under strict constraints
- compressed timelines with limited recovery windows
- accumulation of accountability across cycles

These patterns may persist
even when performance appears controlled.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that discipline or structure
restores recovery capacity.

Under sustained high-stakes load,
recovery competes with continuous cognitive vigilance,
making structural adjustments insufficient.

Understanding load structure
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained high-stakes load
- emotional detachment as a protective response
- persistence of load across decision cycles

It does not evaluate competence,
ethics, or financial outcomes.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
