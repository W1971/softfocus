# Burnout test for founders

## Role load context

In founder roles, burnout risk is commonly associated with sustained
decision load rather than task volume.

Typical load patterns include:
- continuous high-stakes decision making
- unresolved responsibility without clear endpoints
- long planning horizons with limited feedback
- pressure to remain cognitively available at all times

These loads persist even when execution is delegated.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Most advice assumes that reducing effort restores capacity.

Under burnout conditions, decision load competes directly with recovery,
making effort-based correction ineffective.

Understanding capacity constraints precedes action.
This assessment exists to clarify those constraints.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained responsibility
- emotional detachment as a protective mechanism
- persistence of load over time

It does not assess leadership skill or business outcomes.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
