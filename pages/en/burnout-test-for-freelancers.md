# Burnout test for freelancers

## Role load context

In freelance roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained self-management and boundary load.

Common load patterns include:
- income uncertainty across work cycles
- blurred boundaries between work and recovery
- continuous availability pressure
- responsibility accumulation without external structure

These patterns may persist
even when workload appears flexible.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that autonomy
naturally improves recovery.

Under sustained self-management load,
recovery competes with ongoing cognitive and decisional demands,
making autonomy insufficient on its own.

Understanding load structure
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained self-management load
- emotional detachment as a compensatory response
- persistence of load across time

It does not evaluate discipline,
motivation, or career choices.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
