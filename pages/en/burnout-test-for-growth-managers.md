# Burnout test for growth managers

## Role load context

In growth management roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained experimentation pressure
under conditions of ambiguous causality.

Common load patterns include:
- continuous hypothesis testing without stable closure
- responsibility for outcomes driven by probabilistic signals
- frequent shifts between strategy, execution, and analysis
- delayed or noisy feedback loops

These loads may accumulate
even when growth metrics appear positive.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that better experimentation frameworks
restore recovery capacity.

Under sustained experimentation pressure,
recovery competes with continuous evaluative switching,
making framework optimization insufficient.

Understanding load dynamics
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained experimentation load
- emotional detachment as a containment response
- persistence of load across growth cycles

It does not evaluate growth strategy,
marketing effectiveness, or metric selection.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
