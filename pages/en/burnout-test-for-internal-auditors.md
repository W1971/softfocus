# Burnout test for internal auditors

## Role load context

In internal audit roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained evaluative responsibility
under conditions of delayed consequence.

Common load patterns include:
- prolonged assessment of control effectiveness
- responsibility for identifying deficiencies without ownership of remediation
- exposure to organizational resistance or defensiveness
- cyclical pressure tied to audit calendars and reviews

These loads may persist
even when findings are limited.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that independence
buffers recovery strain.

Under sustained evaluative load,
recovery competes with ongoing critical assessment,
making role clarity insufficient.

Understanding load dynamics
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained evaluative load
- emotional detachment as a protective response
- persistence of strain across audit cycles

It does not evaluate audit quality,
control maturity, or remediation outcomes.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
