# Burnout test for lawyers

## Role load context

In legal roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained cognitive and accountability load
under adversarial and time-constrained conditions.

Common load patterns include:
- prolonged responsibility for high-stakes outcomes
- precision demands with limited tolerance for error
- exposure to conflict and opposing interests
- compressed timelines with persistent availability expectations

These loads may persist
even when caseloads appear manageable.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that discipline or experience
restores recovery capacity.

Under sustained accountability pressure,
recovery competes with continuous cognitive vigilance,
making structural adjustments insufficient.

Understanding load structure
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained legal accountability
- emotional detachment as a protective response
- persistence of load across case cycles

It does not evaluate competence,
ethics, or professional performance.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
