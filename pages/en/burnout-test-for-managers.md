# Burnout test for managers

## Role load context

In management roles, burnout risk often emerges from sustained
people-related and decision load rather than individual task execution.

Common load patterns include:
- continuous prioritization across competing demands
- emotional regulation in conflict situations
- responsibility without direct control over outcomes
- persistent context switching across teams and issues

These loads accumulate even when work hours appear manageable.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic recommendations assume available recovery capacity.

When burnout is present, additional structure and effort
increase cognitive and decision load instead of resolving it.

Understanding load dynamics is required before change is possible.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained interpersonal load
- emotional detachment as a containment response
- long-term load accumulation patterns

It does not evaluate management effectiveness or competence.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
