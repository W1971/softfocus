# Burnout test for operations managers

## Role load context

In operations management roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained coordination and reliability pressure
rather than visible overwork.

Common load patterns include:
- continuous responsibility for system stability
- dependency management across teams and processes
- interruption-driven decision making
- limited recovery due to ongoing operational exposure

These loads accumulate
even when operations appear under control.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that better planning or structure
restores recovery capacity.

Under sustained coordination pressure,
recovery competes with ongoing situational monitoring,
making incremental optimization ineffective.

Understanding load dynamics
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained operational load
- emotional detachment as a containment response
- persistence of load across operational cycles

It does not evaluate efficiency,
leadership style, or execution quality.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
