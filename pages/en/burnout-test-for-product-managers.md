# Burnout test for product managers

## Role load context

In product management roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained prioritization and trade-off pressure
across competing stakeholders.

Common load patterns include:
- continuous balancing of scope, timelines, and constraints
- responsibility without direct authority over execution
- frequent context switching between strategy and delivery
- long feedback loops with delayed outcome visibility

These loads may accumulate
even when delivery cadence appears stable.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that better frameworks or alignment
restore recovery capacity.

Under sustained prioritization pressure,
recovery competes with ongoing evaluative decision making,
making process optimization insufficient.

Understanding load dynamics
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained prioritization load
- emotional detachment as a containment response
- persistence of load across product cycles

It does not evaluate product quality,
roadmap accuracy, or stakeholder satisfaction.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
