# Burnout test for program managers

## Role load context

In program management roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained coordination and dependency oversight
across multiple initiatives.

Common load patterns include:
- responsibility for cross-project alignment
- dependency management without full control
- interruption-driven prioritization
- prolonged exposure to schedule and delivery risk

These loads may accumulate
even when individual projects appear controlled.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that better planning or tooling
restores recovery capacity.

Under sustained coordination pressure,
recovery competes with continuous situational monitoring,
making planning improvements insufficient.

Understanding load structure
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained program-level load
- emotional detachment as a containment response
- persistence of load across program cycles

It does not evaluate delivery success,
leadership style, or execution outcomes.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
