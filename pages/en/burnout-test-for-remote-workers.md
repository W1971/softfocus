# Burnout test for remote workers

## Role load context

In remote work contexts, burnout risk often emerges from blurred
boundaries and sustained cognitive availability rather than workload.

Common load patterns include:
- continuous low-level task switching
- extended communication windows without closure
- reduced environmental cues for recovery
- isolation combined with performance visibility

These patterns can impair recovery even when schedules appear flexible.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that flexibility improves recovery.

Under burnout conditions, boundary ambiguity increases
cognitive and decision load instead of reducing it.

Understanding load structure is required before adjustment is possible.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under fragmented attention
- emotional detachment as a protective response
- persistence of load across work-rest boundaries

It does not evaluate remote work suitability or discipline.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
