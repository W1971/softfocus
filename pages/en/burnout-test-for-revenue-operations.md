# Burnout test for revenue operations

## Role load context

In revenue operations roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained cross-functional alignment
under conditions of incomplete control.

Common load patterns include:
- coordination across sales, marketing, and finance
- responsibility for systemic consistency without direct authority
- continuous reconciliation of metrics and incentives
- long feedback loops between actions and outcomes

These loads may persist
even when revenue systems appear optimized.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that alignment frameworks
restore recovery capacity.

Under sustained reconciliation pressure,
recovery competes with ongoing evaluative coordination,
making alignment efforts insufficient.

Understanding capacity constraints
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained cross-functional load
- emotional detachment as a protective response
- persistence of load across revenue cycles

It does not evaluate revenue strategy,
growth performance, or system design quality.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
