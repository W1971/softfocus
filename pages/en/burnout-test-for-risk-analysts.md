# Burnout test for risk analysts

## Role load context

In risk analysis roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained exposure to uncertainty
combined with responsibility for anticipation rather than resolution.

Common load patterns include:
- continuous monitoring of potential adverse scenarios
- responsibility for identifying risk without authority to mitigate it
- prolonged vigilance across low-probability, high-impact events
- pressure to maintain alertness despite limited feedback

These loads may persist
even when incidents do not materialize.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that better controls
reduce cognitive strain.

Under sustained anticipatory load,
recovery competes with constant threat evaluation,
making control optimization insufficient.

Understanding load structure
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained anticipatory load
- emotional detachment as a containment response
- persistence of vigilance-related strain over time

It does not evaluate risk models,
forecast accuracy, or mitigation strategies.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
