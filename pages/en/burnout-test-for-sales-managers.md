# Burnout test for sales managers

## Role load context

In sales management roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained decision and coordination load
rather than direct selling activity.

Common load patterns include:
- continuous performance oversight across teams
- responsibility for targets without direct control over execution
- mediation between organizational pressure and team capacity
- persistent availability for escalation and resolution

These loads may accumulate
even when team performance appears stable.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that delegation or structure
restores recovery capacity.

Under sustained managerial pressure,
recovery competes with ongoing decision oversight,
making structural adjustments insufficient.

Understanding load dynamics
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained managerial load
- emotional detachment as a containment response
- persistence of load across management cycles

It does not evaluate leadership style,
coaching ability, or sales results.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
