# Burnout test for sales operations

## Role load context

In sales operations roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained coordination and system-level responsibility
rather than direct selling activity.

Common load patterns include:
- continuous support of multiple sales motions
- responsibility for process integrity under shifting targets
- frequent interruption-driven prioritization
- accountability for outcomes without control over execution

These loads may accumulate
even when sales performance appears stable.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that better tooling or process clarity
restores recovery capacity.

Under sustained operational pressure,
recovery competes with continuous monitoring and correction,
making tooling improvements insufficient.

Understanding load structure
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained operational load
- emotional detachment as a containment response
- persistence of load across reporting and planning cycles

It does not evaluate sales strategy,
quota design, or revenue outcomes.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
