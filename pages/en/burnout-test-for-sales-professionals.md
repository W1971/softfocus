# Burnout test for sales professionals

## Role load context

In sales roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained performance pressure under variable outcomes.

Common load patterns include:
- quota-driven decision making under uncertainty
- repeated exposure to rejection and negotiation
- fluctuating performance cycles without recovery closure
- continuous availability expectations

These patterns may persist
even when short-term results appear strong.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that motivation or effort
restores recovery capacity.

Under sustained performance pressure,
recovery competes with ongoing emotional and decisional demands,
making effort-based correction ineffective.

Understanding load structure
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained sales pressure
- emotional detachment as a compensatory response
- persistence of load across performance cycles

It does not evaluate skill,
talent, or sales results.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
