# Burnout test for strategy analysts

## Role load context

In strategy analysis roles, burnout risk is often associated
with sustained evaluative reasoning
under uncertainty and long time horizons.

Common load patterns include:
- responsibility for interpretation without execution authority
- prolonged exposure to ambiguous or incomplete data
- repeated reframing of assumptions under shifting constraints
- delayed validation of analytical conclusions

These loads may accumulate
even when analysis output remains coherent.

## Why generic advice often fails here

Generic advice assumes that insight or clarity
restores recovery capacity.

Under sustained evaluative load,
recovery competes with continuous cognitive reassessment,
making insight generation insufficient.

Understanding load dynamics
precedes any attempt at change.

## What this burnout test measures

This assessment evaluates:
- recovery capacity under sustained evaluative load
- emotional detachment as a containment response
- persistence of load across strategic cycles

It does not evaluate analytical talent,
strategic correctness, or business impact.

## Non-clinical boundary

This assessment is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.
