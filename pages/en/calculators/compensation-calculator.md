# Compensation load calculator

## What this calculator does

This calculator quantifies compensation pressure
under constrained recovery capacity.

It does not provide advice or recommendations.
Its purpose is analytical and interpretive.

## Inputs

The calculation is based on:
- recovery capacity level
- current load intensity
- load persistence over time

## Output

The result reflects the degree to which
compensation mechanisms are required
to offset sustained load.

## Non-clinical boundary

This calculator is non-clinical.
It does not provide diagnosis or treatment
and does not replace medical or psychological care.

## Calculation

Results are generated deterministically
based on the provided inputs.
