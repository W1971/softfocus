# SoftFocus — Product Manifesto

## What we do
SoftFocus helps identify misalignment between recovery and cognitive load.
We provide structured orientation, not prescriptions.

## What we do NOT do
- No medical diagnosis
- No recommendations
- No motivation or coaching
- No action plans

## Core principle
Understanding precedes action.
Clarity precedes motivation.
